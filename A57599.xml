            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Saul</hi> had been poſſeſt with an Implacable Spirit of Envy (ſuch as no Harp could lay) from the time that the Women ſang in their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Saul <hi>has ſlain his thouſands, and</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>his ten thouſands.</hi> Little did thoſe ſweet Singers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if they may be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, think, how great a Diſcord that their praiſing Melody, which gave the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>David,</hi> a Son and Subject, above <hi>Saul,</hi> his Father and Sovereign, would make in the heart of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>David;</hi> in ſo much that ever after he hunted him <hi>like a Partridge upon the Mountains.</hi> Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42196:8"/>no ſacrifice great enough, to expiate for that his <hi>Crimen Alienum,</hi> or other folks fault, in over-commending him; but the life and heart-blood of him that was ſo commended: Which ſheweth us, that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpoke like an Oracle, when he ſaid, <hi>Who can ſtand before Envy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> returning from following the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins (I had almoſt ſaid like a Lyon, that hath taſted blood and thirſts for more) was told that <hi>David</hi> was in the Wilderneſs of <hi>En-gedi,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>Forthwith he took three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand choſen men out of all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and went to ſeek</hi> David <hi>and his men upon the Rocks of the Wild Goats.</hi> No Rock, but he who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Rock of Ages,</hi> was ſufficient for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s ſecurity, or can be for ours. In <hi>ver.</hi> 3. it is ſaid, that <hi>Saul came to the Sheep-Cotes by the way;</hi> thinking poſſibly that the Shepherds, of whoſe Profeſſion <hi>David</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was, could inform concerning him; where, ſaith the Text, <hi>Was a Cave, which</hi> Saul <hi>went into, to cover his feet.</hi> It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that David <hi>and his men remained in the ſides of that Cave;</hi> and no wonder, becauſe as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us, there were ſome <hi>Spelunca</hi> or Caves, eſpecially towards <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Iturea,</hi> where, in time of War, Shepherds hid themſelves and their flocks; yea where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42196:8"/>all the Inhabitants of Villages and ſmall Cities, did repair for ſhelter; ſome of them being able to contain at once four thouſand men. The Mouths of ſome of thoſe Caves were ſo ſmall and full of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that no man at his Entrance could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy thoſe that were within; but thoſe that were within could eſpy thoſe that were entring: ſo that <hi>David</hi> and his men ſaw <hi>Saul</hi> coming, but he ſaw not them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went on ſecurely, little ſuſpecting that he was within one ſtep of death, if God and <hi>David</hi> had ſo pleaſed. And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he laid by his uppermoſt Garment, the Skirt whereof <hi>David</hi> was ſaid to have cut off, and might be more prone to do, when it was ſeparated from that ſacred Body to which it did belong, than when Gods A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed had it on; to whoſe holy Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>David</hi> had ſpecial regard, though his followers had none; Witneſs their words, ver. 4. <hi>And the men of</hi> David <hi>ſaid unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord ſaid unto thee, I will deliver thine Enemy into thine hands; that thou mayeſt do to him as it ſhall ſeem good to thee: meaning that thou mayeſt kill him.</hi> Counſel worthy of ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors as they, who were a parcel of Runnagates, men in debt, and in diſtreſs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42196:9"/>and of deſperate fortunes; who looked for nothing but a Jail or worſe, if <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould live to be reconciled to <hi>David.</hi> Men like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to have been <hi>Saul</hi>'s Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if <hi>David</hi> had but ſaid the word, Strike off his Head, or, Cut his Throat: For of that ſort of men I preſume are all the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of Horrid and Bloody Edicts. But as bad and faithleſs men as they were, they prefume not to give ſuch counſel, as that, without a religious pretext and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for what they ſaid. They countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this their ſanguinary Advice with three ſpecious things, <hi>viz.</hi> Divine <hi>Prophecy, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi> For, ſay they, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the day of which the Lord ſaid unto thee, Behold I will deliver thine Enemy into thine hand.</hi> Which words ſeem to refer to ſome <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> of that Nature, which God had made, to <hi>David,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Nathan, Gad,</hi> or <hi>Samuel;</hi> though there be no ſuch Prophecy or Promiſe recorded in Scripture; which cauſeth ſome to think that <hi>Providence</hi> was the onely Argument which <hi>David</hi>'s Ragged Regiment and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed Crew of Deſperadoes made uſe of, to ſtir him up to take away the life of <hi>Saul.</hi> And then they read the words thus, Behold the Day of which the Lord <hi>ſaith</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42196:9"/>unto thee; putting in the <hi>Preſent Tenſe per Enallegen temporis,</hi> for the <hi>Preterperfect:</hi> Carrying the ſenſe thus, Behold this is the day in which the Lord by the plain voice of a ſignal <hi>Providence,</hi> hath told thee, that he hath put King <hi>Saul</hi> into thine hand, to do with him what ſeems good in thine Eyes. Having now ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting and charming a Providence before thee, be not thou like the Deaf Adder, that hearkeneth not to the voice of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, though he charm ever ſo ſweetly. Yea methinks I hear ſome of them ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>David,</hi> as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Eliſha,</hi> concerning thoſe Enemies whom he had led blind-fold into <hi>Samaria, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I ſmite? ſhall I ſmite?</hi> Or as he ſaid, <hi>Let me ſmite but once, and I will not ſmite again.</hi> Behold a Price is put into the hand of a Fool, if he have not the heart to improve it.</p>
                  <p>So plain and powerful was the Argument taken from <hi>Providence,</hi> always amongſt thoſe, whoſe Fingers itched to be doing, and whoſe mouths watered at that, for which they had no better Arguments. The force and ſtreſs of which Argument lies here, <hi>What may be done, may be done.</hi> That is, what may be done <hi>de facto,</hi> may be done
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42196:10"/>
                     <hi>de jure;</hi> or whatſoever God makes poſſible by an unuſual ſeries of Providence (as is the cutting off a Kings Head when it is once brought to the Block) is thereby intimated to be <hi>lawful,</hi> yea <hi>neceſſary</hi> and our <hi>duty.</hi> So opportunity makes a Thief, and a good opportunity makes it a Judges Duty to condemn him, and an Executioners to put him to death. But poſſibly theſe Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean or Cave Councellors of <hi>Davids,</hi> that they might have three ſtrings to their Bow; did really intend to urge alſo a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> from God in the Caſe (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any or no) a Practice uſual in more modern Ages, to encourage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion by ſome pretended Prophecy of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the Caſe. When men that intend Rebellion, can alledge ſignal Providences purſuant of Prophecies, and Promiſes for their purpoſe, as alſo <hi>Prophecies,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling thoſe things, which a train of ſucceſsful providences ſeem to make way for; they ſeem then to ſail before Wind and Tide, doubt not but to get ſafely, yea, and honeſtly too, into the harbour of their deſigns, and to get Complices e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear them company.</p>
                  <p>But ſince that providence hath tackt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout like the Wind (though it held for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42196:10"/>twenty years in one Corner) I do imagine that the Engliſh Logicians (who formerly made more uſe of that Topick than of any other, could wiſh that an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex Expurgatorius</hi> might paſs upon it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Wind, which for ſo many years paſt was with and for them, is now as much againſt them. And if they will ſtill hold that old Argument taken from Providence, it is to be hoped it will make them good and loyal Subjects; becauſe as miraculous a ſeries of Providence as any they could ever pretend to, hath given us the happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of His Majeſty, and firmly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him upon his Throne.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, The Counſel of <hi>David</hi>'s followers ſeemed to make ſome Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him, and that ſomething did ſtick; (as they ſay there will, when men do <hi>forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calumniari</hi>) for that he adventured to <hi>cut off</hi> Saul<hi>'s Skirt:</hi> as who ſhould ſay he would try whether the Ice would bear him, before he would venture to walk or ſlide upon it; but finding it to Give, Thaw, or Crack under him, I mean his Heart to fail him when he had done no more but ſo, he preſently ſtarted back, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience recoiled upon him, and gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the words of my Text, <hi>And</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42196:11"/>
                     <hi>Heart ſmote him becauſe he had cut off</hi> Saul<hi>'s Skirt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words do plainly conſiſt of three general parts, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt of all <hi>David ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> ſecondly, that which ſmote him, <hi>viz. his Heart;</hi> thirdly, the reaſon why his Heart ſmote him, becauſe he <hi>cut off</hi> Saul<hi>'s Skirt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpend but a few words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſeveral parts of the Text. By <hi>Davids Heart</hi> we are to underſtand his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> for ſo ſome Interpreters render it, <hi>Redarguit Davidem Conſcientia ſua.</hi> Now the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of Man may well be called his <hi>Heart,</hi> becauſe Naturalliſts give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Heart of Man; that it is, <hi>Primum vivens ultimus moriens:</hi> ſo is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt thing that lives, when man begins the Life of Religion, and the laſt thing that dies, when a man forſakes that Life; for whilſt a man has one ſpark of Religion abiding in him, it remains in his <hi>Conſcience.</hi> As for the word <hi>ſmote him,</hi> though it be a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> I hope it may be pardoned, becauſe I find few Texts of Scripture in which is no <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor;</hi> and the ſenſe of it is plainly this, That <hi>Davids</hi> Heart did rebuke him. As for the laſt words, <hi>becauſe he cut off</hi> Saul<hi>'s
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42196:11"/>Skirt;</hi> they are ſo plain nothing can make them plainer.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt eaſie to eſpy, in theſe words thus divided and explained, theſe Four Propoſitions, <hi>viz. Firſt of all, That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a Smiter, or one that will ſmite men firſt or laſt, if they give occaſion.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That Conſcience doth ſmite men ſometimes for ſins comparatively ſmall,</hi> as <hi>Davids</hi> Heart did for cutting off but <hi>Saul's Skirt.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That the ſame Conſcience hath and doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſmite men for ſmall ſins, which for a time hath given them no rebuke for much greater tranſgreſſions;</hi> witneſs the Heart of <hi>David,</hi> which for a conſiderable time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him not for his Adultery with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> nor yet for murthering her innocent Husband <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and yet now ſmote him for but cutting off of the Lap of <hi>Sauls Skirt.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That Affronts and Injuries offered to Superiours are ſins, for which Conſcience is as apt to ſmite men, as for moſt that are committed againſt either Table.</hi> Of which I ſhall give an account hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But now for the firſt of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, It may take in the two Later, to which I ſhall therefore apply my ſelf; and in purſuance of it, inquire into Nine <hi>Particulars</hi> (or whether I ſhould rather call them <hi>Generals,</hi> I am not as yet ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42196:12"/>
                     <hi>viz. Quid, Or what is Conſcience;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Quod, the</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Or that Conſcience is a ſmiter;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Propter quod, Or for what it is that Conſcience uſeth to ſmite:</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Quos, Or who they are that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience takes the boldneſs, or uſeth to ſmite:</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Quibus, Or by what means and methods Conſcience is ſtirr'd up to ſmite men:</hi> Sixthly, <hi>Quando, When and at what ſeaſons Conſcience uſeth to ſmite:</hi> Seventhly, <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu, How long Conſcience holds on Chiding:</hi> Eighthly, <hi>Quomodo, How or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Conſcience uſeth to ſmite:</hi> Ninthly, <hi>Quare, Why or by what Authority Conſcience preſumes to ſmite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe Nine Particulars will take up all we mean to ſay upon the Doctrinal part of this Text, which we intend to finiſh in a ſhort Application. We begin with the firſt of theſe, namely the <hi>Quid,</hi> or to ſhew <hi>what Conſcience is.</hi> Conſcience is well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by <hi>Ameſius,</hi> to be <hi>Judicium Hominis de ſemetipſo prout ſubjecitur Judicio Dei. That is the Judgment of a Man concerning himſelf, as it is ſubjected to the Judgment of God, Iſa.</hi> 5.3. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.31. But more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſcience is, that which excuſeth when we do well; condemneth us when we do ill: <hi>If our Hearts condemn us,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42196:12"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Commendeth us when we do well; Confounds us, or rather puts us to ſhame and confuſion of Face, when we leave undone the things we ought to do, or do the things we ought to leave undone; and on the other hand comforts us, and fills us with joy, when we leave undone what we ought to leave undone, and do the things which we ought to do, and as we ought to do them. Hence thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our Rejoycing is this, The teſtimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that in godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Conſcience is a Court ſet up by God in every mans Breaſt, and hath a three-fold Office aſſign'd it, <hi>viz.</hi> That of a <hi>Plaintiff or Accuſer;</hi> Secondly, <hi>Of a Witneſs or Evidence;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Of a Judge;</hi> for <hi>Conſcience</hi> is all theſe in one. If any man put the Queſtion, <hi>What is Conſcience?</hi> as <hi>Pilate</hi> of old, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> Methinks I ſee Conſcience it ſelf ſtand ready to anſwer him: Knoweſt not thou who, and what I <hi>Conſcience</hi> am, whence I come, and whether I would? Art thou ſo much a ſtranger at home, ſo much a ſtranger to thy ſelf, of whom I am part? I am nearer to thee than he or ſhe that is Fleſh of thy Fleſh and Bone of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42196:13"/>thy Bone; than the Husband or Wife of thy Boſome: I was brought up with thee in thy Nonage, and was thy Boſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion from the time thou didſt firſt know thy right hand from thy left; I have been with thee early and late, talked with thee many an hour in thy Bed, and in the ſtill and dead of the night; I have kept thee waking many an hour when thou wouldſt fain have ſlept, calling thy ſins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; and ſeting them in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee: Many a time have I made thee <hi>bluſh,</hi> many a time have I made thee <hi>cry,</hi> and water thy Couch with thy <hi>tears;</hi> ſometimes have I made thee quake and tremble, and make thy very Bed to ſhake under thee; And knoweſt thou me not all this while? Other times have I ſpoken good and comfortable words to thee; come to thee with an Olive Branch of Peace in my Mouth, and ſaid to thee in Gods Name, whoſe vicegerent I am, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant:</hi> Or as the Angel of God ſaid to <hi>Cornelius</hi> in a Viſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4. <hi>Thy Prayers and thy Alms are come up for a Memorial before God;</hi> or as the words are <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Go thy way, eat thy Bread with joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy Works.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42196:13"/>have I made thee <hi>a Feaſt of Fat Things, and of Wines refined on the Lees;</hi> for a good Conſcience, thou knoweſt is a continual Feaſt; <hi>of Fat Things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well refined.</hi> Hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ask no body but thy ſelf who I am; <hi>Who ſhould know the things of a Man, but the Spirit of Man which is in him?</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks. And ſurely among the things of a Man, I <hi>Conſcience</hi> am the greateſt; I am that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth the <hi>Candle of the Lord, Searching all the inward parts of the Belly:</hi> I am that great thing which ſome have called a god; for it is an old ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Though indeed I am but Gods Vice Roy, or one of thoſe that are called gods. In a word, I'll ſay no more what I am, for I am ſo inconſiderable when my Saviour is but once mentioned, that I am not worthy ſpeaking of; yet I am not juſt nothing at all: therefore let him that was writing of me, proceed and tell you how it doth appear that I am that Smiter, that Reprover, that <hi>Bonarges,</hi> that Son of Thunder, that he has told you I am; and that will bring him from the <hi>Quid</hi> to the <hi>Quod;</hi> which is the next thing to be ſpoke to.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42196:14"/>
                  <p>Secondly, I am obliged in the next place to prove that which may as eaſily admit a proof as any thing, yea indeed needs no proof at all, <hi>viz. That Conſcience is a faculty in the Soul of Man, that will ſmite firſt or laſt if occaſion be given.</hi> I ſay it ſeems to need no proof, for what need is there for any man to prove by Reaſon and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that there is ſuch a thing as the <hi>Gout, Stone,</hi> or <hi>Collick;</hi> or that theſe things are painful when they ſeize People violently: ſeeing the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of every man that has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſmart diſcipline of all or any of theſe, aſſures him that ſo it is. What the Apoſtle ſaith of Afflictions, may be applied to the chaſtiſings of <hi>Conſcience: If you are without Chaſtiſement, whereof all are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, ye are Baſtards and not Sons.</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>That by the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word is confirmed.</hi> We ſhall therefore alledge Three credible Witneſſes, <hi>viz. Scripture, Experience,</hi> and <hi>Sound Reaſon;</hi> whereby <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> to eſtabliſh the point in hand. It is none of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or things but once written in the Holy Scriptures; <hi>That Conſcience is a Smiter:</hi> for this we find aſſerted over and over, both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42196:14"/>Witneſs firſt the famous inſtance of this truth, in the firſt <hi>Adam; Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And he ſaid, <hi>I heard thy voice in the Garden and I was afraid, becauſe I was naked; and and hid my ſelf.</hi> The meaning whereof is, That when <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten of the forbidden Fruit, his <hi>Conſcience</hi> did forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fly or ſpit in his Face, and put him into a pannick fear, and to a woful ſhame; ſo that he could almoſt have buried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alive, or gone down to Hell; could he there have been hid from the preſence and diſpleaſure of an angry God. Our next inſtance ſhall be in <hi>Cain.</hi> Did his <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſmite him or did it not? Yea almoſt as mortally as he ſmote his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel;</hi> witneſs thoſe words of his <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>And</hi> Cain <hi>ſaid unto the Lord, My puniſhment is greater than I can bear; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou haſt driven me out this day from the Face of the Earth, and from thy Face ſhall I be hid; and I ſhall be a Fugitive and a Vagaboud in the Earth: and it ſhall come to paſs that every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me; v.</hi> 14. See here the doleful Bodings of a guilty ſmiting Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The Third Witneſs that we ſhall call, ſhall be that paſſage in <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>And they</hi> (viz.) Joſeph<hi>'s</hi> Brethren) <hi>ſaid one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42196:15"/>we are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us and we would not hear; therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Fourth inſtance would be one more than I promis'd, but you may have it in <hi>Judges</hi> 1.7. <hi>And</hi> Adoni-Bezek <hi>ſaid, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten Kings, having their Thumbs and their great Toes cut off, gathered meat under my Table; As I have done, ſo God hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me.</hi>

                  <p>Let the famous inſtance of <hi>Judas</hi> bring up the Rear, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.3. <hi>Then</hi> Judas, <hi>which had betrayed him</hi> (viz. our Saviour) <hi>when he ſaw that he was condemned, repented himſelf; ſaying, I have ſinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood: And he caſt down the pieces of Silver in the Temple, and went and hanged himſelf;</hi> verſe 4, 5.

                  <p>We have been already compaſſed about with a ſufficient Cloud of Scriptural Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. In the next place you may find thoſe Witneſſes backt with <hi>Experience,</hi> I mean the <hi>Experience</hi> not of one, but of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; which need not be preſſed, but will come in, in the Quality of <hi>Volunteers,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42196:15"/>and offer its ſervice to atteſt this truth. That there is a God, hath not more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages from the light of Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience of Mankind; then that there is a Smiter, or Reprover in every Mans Breaſt, called Conſcience; I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid I appeal to every mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that there is a Reprover in his Breaſt, which when he <hi>ruſheth into Sin as the Horſe into the Battle, and drinketh in Sin, as the Fiſh doth Water;</hi> Curbs and checks him for ſo doing, tells him he ought not to miſpend his precious time, to waſte thoſe golden ſands of time, which once run out, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be recalled: Tells him that he ought to mind the Errand for which God ſent him into the World, <hi>and ſet all men upon the face of the earth, viz. To ſeek after God, if hapily they might feel after him, and find him,</hi> Acts 17. v. 27. And tells him in caſe he doth otherwiſe, that he plays <hi>Jonah,</hi> who ſet ſail for <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> when God ſent him to <hi>Nineveh;</hi> and may juſtly expect, that a ſtorm of Divine Wrath will purſue him, that he ſhall be caſt into the Deep, into the midſt of the Seas; and all Gods Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Waves ſhall paſs over him: as it is <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.3. Tells him that ſith <hi>he names the name of Chriſt, he ſhould depart from all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42196:16"/>iniquity; ſhould deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts; live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly, in the preſent world; and that tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſhall be upon every ſoul that obeys not the truth: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Chriſtian firſt, and then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heathen; for this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world; and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>

                  <p>Now to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> the two fore-cited witneſſes; I ſhall add a third, <hi>viz. Reaſon:</hi> That three-fold Cord can ſurely never be broken: Hear then what <hi>Reaſon</hi> can ſay on the behalf of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> it being a <hi>Smiter:</hi> I know, ſaith <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the frame and make of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is ſuch as it is; as well as I know that a keen Axe muſt needs be apt to cut, becauſe it hath ſo ſharp an Edge. <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a <hi>Natural Logician, Apta Natu,</hi> that is, naturally fitted to frame <hi>Syllogiſmes;</hi> concerning which 'tis a conſtant and infallible Rule, <hi>That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion doth alwayes follow the worſe and weaker part of the Premiſes. Concluſio ſemper ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur partem deteriorem.</hi> If then <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſhall thus ſyllogize (as often it doth) he that believeth not in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he that loveth not Jeſus Chriſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and ſuperlatively, he that forſaketh not his Sins, he that mortifieth not the Fleſh, with the Luſts and Affections thereof, is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth upon him; and then aſſumes or takes this for his minor Propoſition: But thou, O my Soul, believeſt not, thou loveſt not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thou haſt not forſaken thy Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then will it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42196:17"/>be forced to fall foul upon a Man, with this Concluſion, <hi>Ergo</hi> or <hi>therefore,</hi> thou art condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on thee.</p>
                  <p>I hope by this time, I have proved the <gap reason="foreign">

In general it is for ſin, real or ſuppoſed, moſt commonly real. Now though <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> doth many times wink at ſmall faults (though not alwayes ſo neither) give me leave to tell you, it ſeldome forbears to ſmite for great and crying Abominations, ſuch are, firſt <hi>of all ſins committed againſt the clear Light of Nature, as well as of Scripture;</hi> ſuch as the Apoſtle chargeth them with <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. v. 32. <hi>Who knowing the Judgment of God, that they who commit ſuch things are worthy of death; not onely do the ſame, but have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them that do them.</hi> When Chriſtians venture to do thoſe things, which even Heathens know ought not to be done, namely, to do to others what they would nor others ſhould do unto them; to tell pernicious Lies, to perjure, or ſuborn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, to the undoing of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42196:17"/>
                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſmites for ſuch faults as thoſe, will it not fetch blood, and make every blow it gives pierce to the very heart? Secondly, <hi>Thoſe ſins whereto even corrupted Nature ſeems to have an antipathy, averſation and abhorrence,</hi> as namely, Horrid ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards our beſt Friends, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing Evil for Good; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I have done many good works among you, for which of theſe do you go about to ſtone me? John</hi> 10.32. Cruelty to a mans own Fleſh and Blood, as in Parents towards Children, and Children towards Parents, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther near Relations one towards another; Inceſt and the like: When <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſmites ſuch Fools as theſe, doth it not, as it were <hi>Bray them in a Morter,</hi> break them upon the Wheel, put them upon a Rack, give no Quarter, and Refuſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ure for their much crying.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe ſins which are at once a manifeſt breach of both the Tables of Gods Law, and which either ſmite at men, as it were through the Loyns of God Almighty, or at God Almighty through the Loyns of Men:</hi> As for Example, When <hi>Jezebel</hi> ſuborned Witneſſes to forſwear themſelves againſt <hi>Naboth,</hi> that ſhe might take away his Life; What was that but a ſmiting of <hi>Naboth,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42196:18"/>through the Loyns of God Almighty: And on the other hand, When wicked men have perſecuted the Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, ſpilt their Blood as Water upon the Ground, becauſe they bore the Image of their Heavenly Father; What was that but to ſmite at God himſelf, through the Loyns of Men? To crucifie our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our again in <hi>Effigie,</hi> and to tell the World, (but that <hi>the Heaven of Heavens muſt contain him till the reſtitution of all things</hi>) they would have done as much to him, as they have done to his Friends and Followers. Now <hi>Conſcience</hi> is wont to ſtir up all its Wrath as it were, to heat the Furnace of its Indignation ſeven times hotter than at other times, when ſuch Miſcreants as theſe are to be caſt into it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thoſe ſins which are of dreadful and horred conſequence, which produce amazing and aſtoniſhing evil Effects;</hi> which imbrew Nations in Blood, and pluck down Divine Vengeance upon Cities and Kingdoms; like the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> which laid thoſe famous Cities all in Aſhes; or like <hi>Davids numbring the People,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Subjects to one of three dreadful Judgments (chooſe him whether) the leaſt whereof was the Plague or Peſtilence;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42196:18"/>when <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſmites for ſuch things as theſe it even breaks Mens Bones, it makes them <hi>Magor Miſſabibs,</hi> that is Terrors round about to themſelves, ready to fall into the jaws of deſpair, curſing the day of their birth; as did <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1.3. upon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, and crying out as he v. 11. <hi>Why died I not from the Womb? Why did I not give up the Ghoſt when I came out of the Belly?</hi> When <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſmites at this rate, ah who can live?</p>
                  <p>But Fifthly and laſtly (to name no more) <hi>Preſumptuous ſins, that is, ſins committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt full Conriction of their real and hainous ſinfulneſs againſt the Lord; Out-cryes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Friends, Holy Miniſters, and above all, of Mens own Conſciences, crying out and ſaying, O do not this abominable thing which the Soul of God hateth; ſins againſt faireſt warnings, given by Gods ſignal Judgments, executed upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the like nature, ſins againſt the higheſt obligations of ſtupendious mercies, obliging men to the contrary; and aggravated by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever other circumſtances do aggravate the ſins of men:</hi> Theſe preſumptious ſins (as I call them) do make the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men to ſmite, till even themſelves be ſick with ſmiting; and to give the ſinner little or no reſt day or night, cauſing him to cry out,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42196:19"/>
                     <hi>My wounds ſtink and are corrupt, becauſe of my fooliſhneſs; there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh becauſe of my ſin; mine iniquites are gone over my Head, and are a burthen too heavy for me to bear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now that <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſhould ſmite for ſuch crying and crimſon ſins as theſe is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but what ſhould be the meaning of its ſmiting men, as now and than it doth, for ſmall ſins, for motes in their eyes, for meer Peccadillo's: When poor <hi>Jonathans</hi> have taſted but a little Honey upon the tip of their Staves, Why muſt they die for ſo doing? Why muſt <hi>

Why muſt the Carkaſſes of ſo many <hi>Beth-ſhemites</hi> fall, onely for the moſt pardonable curioſitie, as it may ſeem, <hi>viz.</hi> To look into Gods Ark, whilſt the Angels of God themſelves are allowed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>to ſtoop down and to pry into Gods Miſteries?</hi> Why muſt <hi>David</hi> loſe ſo great a number of his innocent Subjects, as he call'd them, <hi>when he ſaid, What have theſe Sheep done?</hi> onely becauſe their King and Shepherd made bold to number them: Why ſince it is a <hi>Maxim</hi> in the Laws of <hi>England. Lex non curat de minimis. The Law
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42196:19"/>troubles not it ſelf with trivial faults.</hi> I ſay, Why doth the All-merciful God either ſmite himſelf, or ſuffer <hi>Conſcience</hi> to ſmite at ſo great a rate for ſmall Tranſgreſſions; for cutting off not the Head of a King, but meerly the Skirt of his Garment? Or how can he be ſaid to be merciful that does ſo? Hath he appointed <hi>Conſcience</hi> not onely not <hi>to ſwallow Camels,</hi> but <hi>to ſtrain at Gnats?</hi> Is this the manner of Men that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted mild and merciful?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It were eaſie for me to take up the Authors of this objection very ſhort, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than this: <hi>Who art thou O man that replieſt againſt God?</hi> But ſince it may eaſily be done, I ſhall gratifie them with a more full and ſatisfactory account of this matter, in the following Particulars: Firſt of all, <hi>God doth therefore puniſh ſmall ſins (ſuch I mean in compariſon of others) with great temporal Puniſhments, and ſet</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>at work ſometimes to chide for them at a great rate, to let the World know there is no ſin ſmall abſolutely but comparatively.</hi> For as much as every ſin is committed againſt God, who is infinitely good; and in that reſpect is <hi>Ex parte objecti,</hi> a kind of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil. As there is no wilful Murther, Inceſt, Sodomy, Beſtiality, Perjury, or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42196:20"/>Treaſon, which is in it ſelf a ſmall crime; yet there are ſome of all theſe which are ſmall in compariſon of other faults of the ſame denomination, clothed with much more aggravating circumſtances, as we commonly hear of <hi>Petty Treaſon,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> ſo there are Petty Thefts, Petty Oaths, of which ſins we may ſay, as of the Stars of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> They are all great, though not all of the ſame magnitude; for all Stars are not Stars of the firſt magnitude. Secondly, <hi>God ſometimes ſmites ſeverely, both by himſelf and by Conſcience (his Vice-Roy) for ſmall ſins, to let men know that the ſmalleſt ſins deſerve, though not the greateſt of eternal, yet of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhments; though not the worſt place in Hell, yet the worſt condition can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in this World:</hi> elſe God had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, in laying what he did lay upon <hi>Job;</hi> whoſe ſins were meer <hi>Motes</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the ſins of many other Men, which were like <hi>Beams;</hi> and yet his Afflictions were like great <hi>Beams,</hi> whilſt theirs were but little <hi>Motes</hi> or Atomes, dancing in the Sun. To puniſh any man one grain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his demerit, were one grain of Injuſtice, which is altogether incompatible with the Righteouſneſs of God: Surely the greateſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42196:20"/>of temporal Judgments are but <hi>finite,</hi> and therefore the leaſt of ſins being infinitely evil, <hi>Ex parte objecti,</hi> or as it is, againſt an <hi>infinite good,</hi> cannot but deſerve it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore doth God ſuffer men to be ſmitten at a very great rate, both by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and their own Conſciences, for ſmall ſins (which they uſe to call</hi> Zoar<hi>'s, ſaying they are but little ones and their Souls ſhall live) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his infinite Purity and Holineſs; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a hater of all ſin, that he cannot behold the leaſt without indignation;</hi> as if the Apple of his Eyes were thereby touched: and a very Mote will diſturb the Apple of ones Eye.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>We may humbly conceive that God puts a Rod into the hands of</hi> Conſcience, <hi>in order, to its ſmiting men for ſmall ſins, for this merciful end, that he may reſtrain them from committing greater.</hi> He whoſe Heart ſmote him for cutting off but <hi>Sauls Skirt,</hi> was in no danger of ever adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to cut off his Head.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>God may be ſuppoſed by Conſcience and by himſelf, to ſmite men ſeverely for ſmall ſins, that thereby he may make other men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of committing greater; and they who have committed greater to quake and tremble, when they conſider what God hath done by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42196:21"/>thoſe whoſe ſins were far leſs than theirs;</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within themſelves, <hi>If this be done to the green Tree, what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi> And <hi>if Judgment thus begin, as it were, at the Houſe of God, where ſhall the wicked and ungodly appear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope by this time my Reader is ſatisfied in the reaſons why God doth ſometimes puniſh ſins comparatively but ſmall, with great and grievous Judgments, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with ſharp ſtings and reflections of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ſhall now ask me why God doth not puniſh all ſins alike in this Life, and every ſmall tranſgreſſion as ſeverely as he did <hi>Davids</hi> numbering the People? I might anſwer him by another Queſtion, namely, Why do not Magiſtrates put to death all condemned Perſons, Thieves and others; but onely tranſport ſome, whilſt they hang others; and while ſome are executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a day or two, give others a long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive, and poſſibly in concluſion a pardon? Is there any Injuſtice in ſo doing? No ſurely, for Juſtice and Mercy do not interfere, but do ſweetly accord and kiſs each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilſt Mercy keeps within its <hi>Zodiack</hi> (to allude to the motion of the Sun) though it hath an <hi>Ecliptick Line,</hi> which ſeems not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42196:21"/>ſo ſtrait, yet it treſpaſſeth not upon the Bounds or Land-marks of Juſtice: Take it in the caſe of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> who though he hanged his <hi>Baker,</hi> that had diſpleaſed him, was not unjuſt, though his pleaſure was to lift up the Head of his <hi>Butler,</hi> who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly was in the ſame Tranſgreſſion, as well as in the ſame Priſon with him; not upon the Gallows, as he did the <hi>Baker,</hi> but in the Preferments of his Court. A Creditor, who having two Debtors, ſhall caſt one of them into Priſon, who all things conſidered, deſerves to be ſo dealt with; is not unjuſt, though at the ſame time he ſhall freely forgive the other as great or greater a Debt.</p>
                  <p>It is highly comporting with Wiſdom and the ends of Government, that ſmall ſins be ſometimes ſeverely puniſhed (eſpecially at the firſt making Laws) to give them ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So God commanded him to <hi>be ſtoned to death, who gathered ſticks upon the Sabbath day;</hi> and ſent <hi>fire from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume</hi> Nadab <hi>and</hi> Abihu, <hi>for offering ſtrange fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is on the other hand as agreeable to Wiſdom and other Perfections, that ſmall faults ſhould generally receive but ſmall puniſhments, that the work and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42196:22"/>as well bad as good, ſhould bear a manifeſt proportion each to other.</p>
                  <p>But the Riddle of all Riddles, as it may ſeem to ſome, is, that which is yet behind, namely, <hi>Why doth God ſometimes ſuffer the Conſciences of men to be quiet and not to ſmite them at all after they have ſinned with a very high hand, when yet the Conſciences of thoſe very men are ſometimes appointed by God to fall foul upon them, for meer Peccadillo's?</hi> Of which we have an inſtance in <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Heart ſmote him, not for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Bathſheba</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> (the two grand faults of his Life, and greateſt blot sin all his Eſcutheon) till ſuch time as <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet came to him, which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been one or more years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and opened his Eyes with the Eye-ſalve of a Parable; whereby he was honeſtly <hi>trapann'd</hi> (if I may ſo ſay) into giving ſentence againſt himſelf. There are principally two reaſons which offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſatisfie us in this point, One taken from the Nature of great Sins, the other from the Juſtice and Wiſdom of God. That from great Sins is this, <hi>'Tis the nature and property of great ſins, to ſtun and ſtupiſie the Conſciences of Men, and as it were to ſtrike them dead; as a great blow is apt to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42196:22"/>put a man paſt all feeling for the preſent:</hi> to deliver him up to an Apoplexy, whilſt a ſmall blow ſhall fill him with Smart and Pain. 'Tis commonly and truly ſaid, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves loquuntur curae Ingentes ſtupent.</hi> And it is moſt certain, that all things which are a great deal too big and too much for us, do naturally aſtoniſh and confound us, be they Griefs or Joyes, Fears or Hopes, Good or Evil Things; which ſutes well with what Naturaliſts ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium ſenſible ledit ſenſorium.</hi> As we ſee too much Light dazzles and blinds our Eyes (though nothing ſo pleaſing to the Eyes as that meaſure of Light which they can bear) and too much noiſe (though moderate ſounds, are the muſick of the ear) do not pleaſe but deafen us; ſo it fareth with Men, who by great ſins have <hi>ſtun'd</hi> their Conſciences, and lain them as it were ſprauling at their feet; they become as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Paſt feeling, Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or as it is expreſſed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that is, <hi>having their Conſciences ſeared with a hot Iron. Conſcientias Cauterio reſectas,</hi> like Veins or Arteries burnt in two; which have no more ſenſe or perception of any thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The reaſon of this, which is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42196:23"/>taken from the Juſtice of God; may be thus explained, <hi>'Tis a righteous thing with God, when Men have ſlighted the frequent and earneſt motions of their Conſciences, to give them up to their own hearts luſts; and to ſay unto Conſcience, Let them alone,</hi> as of old concerning <hi>Ephraim; Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone: Hoſea</hi> 4.17. or as it is in the 14 of that Chap. <hi>I will not puniſh your Daughters when they commit Whoredom, nor your Spouſes when they commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp;c. Or as it is in Pſal.</hi> 11. v. 11, 12. <hi>But my People would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would have none of me; ſo I gave them up to their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own counſels,</hi> &amp;c. This is now the ſoareſt of all Puniſhments in this Life. As nothing afflicts a Sick Man ſo much as to hear his Phyſician ſay, Let him eat and drink what he will, riſe and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad when and where he will; for then he concludes that he has given him over, and looks upon him as paſt all cure; and ſo an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or pleaſant Paſſage out of the World, is all he aims at for him.</p>
                  <p>I forbear to add a third reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Conſcience, when it has found it ſelf of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repulſed, reſiſted and baffled, begins to grow weary of admoniſhing, takes pet, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42196:23"/>ſaith in effect, as the words are,</hi> Rev. 22.11. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill;</hi> or as God himſelf, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould you be ſtricken any more, you will revolt more and more; the whole Head is ſick, and the whole Heart is faint,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Let us now paſs to the fourth thing, which I propounded to ſpeak of; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Quos,</hi> or <hi>who they are that Conſcience doth make bold to ſmite.</hi> In anſwer to that let me tell you, 'Tis much eaſier to declare whom Conſcience hath preſumed to ſmite, than whom it hath not; for doubtleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience fears the Face of no man: it hath ſmitten as <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> as ever were in the World, not doubting to make good its charge againſt them: witneſs <hi>Solomon</hi> for one, if the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> be his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, as it is generally ſuppoſed to be. It hath ſmitten as valiant Men and brave Souldiers as ever drew a Sword; witneſs <hi>David,</hi> who feared not the Face of <hi>Goliah,</hi> that mighty amazing Gyant; he who undauntedly encountered with a <hi>Lion and a Bear;</hi> and gave <hi>Saul,</hi> as a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his Daughter, <hi>two hundred Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins of the Philiſtines,</hi> ſlain by his hand; yet was his Conſcience too much and too
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42196:24"/>hard for him, humbled him, laid him grovelling in the Duſt at its pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Nay it hath ſmitten <hi>as great, rich, and powerful men,</hi> as moſt ever were; witneſs <hi>David,</hi> aforeſaid, and his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> a greater Prince than he, both in Wiſdom and Wealth; both of which Conſcience, when time was, made to lay <hi>their mouths in the duſt, if there might be hope:</hi> Did not Conſcience make its part good with <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> though a kind of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Monarch; <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.4. c. As alſo with <hi>Belſhazar</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6. In theſe words, <hi>Then the Kings Countenance was changed, and his Thoughts troubled him, ſo that the Joynts of his Loins were looſned, and his Knees ſmote one againſt another;</hi> namely, when he ſaw the hand-writting upon the Wall, <hi>Thou art weighed and found too light.</hi> And ſo I have diſpatched the fourth thing, or the <hi>Quos,</hi> ſhewing whom Conſcience makes bold to ſmite, <hi>viz.</hi> As well High as Low, Rich as Poor, Wiſe as Fooliſh, Learned as Unlearned, Princes as People, Men that have the faireſt forms of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as well as thoſe that are openly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; for Conſcience is no Child or Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, to fear Masks and Vizards: and no Changling to be taken with Painted Faces
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42196:24"/>and Artificial Beauties. The next or fifth Head to be ſpoken too, is the <hi>Quibus,</hi> or by what things Conſcience is ordinarily ſtirr'd up to ſmite and chide; and ſome of them are as follow, <hi>viz.</hi> By the Word of God Read or powerfully Preached: which is the reaſon why ſome Perſons, conſcious to themſelves of great ſins wherein they lived, have ſtudiouſly refrained coming to Church, leſt they ſhould meet with rebukes; and others have as generally abſtained from Reading the Holy Scriptures, leſt they ſhould find the Word of God to be quick and powerful, and ſharper than a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sword, and a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart: Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> Reading the Holy Scriptures, was ſmitten to the purpoſe, with that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Let us walk Honeſtly as in the day, not in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, not in Chambering and Wantonneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, Conſcience is ſometimes ſet to work or ſet a work by the private admonition of ſome faithful friend, Miniſter, or other good Chriſtian: So <hi>David</hi>'s ſleepy Conſcience was rouſed and awakened by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> his convincing Parable of the Ewe-Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence that Expreſſion of the Holy <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 141.5,. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42196:25"/>ſhall be a kindneſs; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent Oyl, which ſhall not break my Head:</hi> That is, by the figure <hi>Meioſis,</hi> which ſhall prove ſanative and healing to me; meaning that the wholeſome reproofs of a faithful friend, like thoſe Medicines, which take off the ſtagnation of Blood and Spirits in the Veins and Arteries of Men; and do put them into a free motion and equal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, would as it were ferment his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and by ſo doing, cauſe it to do him a kindneſs. Thirdly, Gods chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon men, ſet their Conſciences a ſmiting. For when God ſmites, Conſcience though it lay ſtill before, is apt to ſmite too; as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who when he ruffled with them, and ſwore by the Life of <hi>Pharoah</hi> they were ſpyes, which might make them to expect to be uſed accordingly; then, and not till then, they ſaid one to another, <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul, and we would not hear; therefore this diſtreſs is come upon us.</hi> In the 33. Chap. of <hi>Job,</hi> where we read of Gods chaſtning Man with Pain upon his Bed, and the multitude of his Bones with ſtrong Pain; ſo that his Life ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horeth Bread, and his Soul dainty Meat;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42196:25"/>his Fleſh is conſumed away that it cannot be ſeen, and his Bones that were not ſeen, ſtick out; his Soul draws near to the Grave, and his Life to the Deſtroyers: then as it is v. 16. God openeth the Ears of Men, and ſealeth their Inſtruction: then as it is v. 23. If there be a Meſſenger with him and an Interpreter, one among a thouſand; which may partly be meant of an awakened Conſcience, by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, v. 27. To ſhew to man his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, then God is gracious to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay the 27. v. may countenance the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring thoſe words to Conſcience, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it by the Interpreter there ſpoken of; becauſe the words there are, He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon Men, and if any ſay, I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and perverted that which is right, and it profited me not, he will deliver his Soul from going into the Pit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Thoſe Afflictions or Judgments, above all others, which carry the Mark and Signature of our Sins upon them, are moſt apt to ſet Conſcience a ſmiting; for read, ſaith Conſcience (as he that runs may) thy ſin in thy ſuffering: behold the plain Prints and foot-ſteps of it, that Face doth not more exactly anſwer to Face in the Glaſs: So in the caſe of <hi>Adoni-Bezek,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42196:26"/>Judges</hi> the 1.7. <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, ſo God hath requited me,</hi> &amp;c. So ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Agag,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.33. <hi>As thy Sword hath made Women Childleſs, ſo ſhall thy Mother be Childleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Women; and</hi> Samuel <hi>hewed</hi> Agag <hi>in pieces before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Fifthly, When men are ſpectators of Gods ſmiting others for the ſame ſins, which themſelves have committed or do commit from day to day; but eſpecially, if for leſs degrees of thoſe ſins than they themſelves are guilty of; then and thereby is Conſcience ſtirr'd up to ſmite them, and doth cauſe them thus to bethink themſelves: If this be done to the green Tree, what ſhall be done to the dry? As for Example, If <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> were ſtruck dead upon the place for telling one lie a-piece, and that but a kind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation neither: O what ſhall become of me, who have told thouſands of lies, who walked in the way of lying, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed God about with lies and deceipt; as it is, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.12. Who have preſſed the God of Truth with Lies, as a Cart is preſſed with Sheaves? What can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but that the Earth ſhould open its
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42196:26"/>Mouth and ſwallow me quick? Now theſe are ſome of the things, for I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to call all to remembrance, which do by the Conſcience of Men, as the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did by <hi>Jonah,</hi> when faſt aſleep in the Ship, <hi>viz.</hi> Call upon them and awaken them, which poſſibly would otherwiſe never awake, till they awoke in Hell, or till Men were drowned in the bottomleſs Pit of Deſtruction. Sixthly, the next thing we propoſe to query, is the <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu,</hi> or how long the ſmitings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience uſe to laſt; how long it uſeth to be before an angry Conſcience become pacified; or before Conſcience, having fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out with Men about ſome great Sin or Sins, become Friends again and give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſmitting? Now to that I reply, No Man can tell, there is no Prophet, that in this caſe knows how long; for it is with the ſmitings of Conſcience, as it is with the Diſeaſes of the Body: Sometimes it ſmites Men without any intermiſſion, and that from day to day; and gives them no reſt day or night: but makes them cry out with <hi>David, Their iniquity is alwayes before them; or ſay with Job,</hi> Chap. 7. v. 13, 14. <hi>When I ſay my Bed ſhall comfort me, and my Couch ſhall caſe my Complaint; then thou
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42196:27"/>ſcareſt me with Dreams, and terrifieſt me through Viſions:</hi> Whereas others again have their hot and cold fits, and between while their well days, wherein they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly exempted from the ſmitings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Again, Some have onely now and then a fit or two of Conſcience and away, which ſome call their <hi>Dumps</hi> or <hi>Melancholies,</hi> and they are up again; the ſmiting of their Conſciences is but as the <hi>Morning Dew, or early Cloud, which ſoon paſſeth away;</hi> 'tis but <hi>April</hi> with them, now and then a Cloud and a Shower, and then the Sun preſently ſhines out again; but in others the ſmitings of Conſcience, are like a Burning Hectick Feaver, never off them. Their Conſciences ſeem to be implacable towards them, and and reſolve to admit of no reconciliation; but to have War with <hi>Amalek</hi> for ever (if I may ſo allude)</p>
                  <p>It were not hard, it may be, to tell you of thoſe who have been under the ſmitings of Conſcience Seven years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or more, I think that was Mrs. <hi>Honywoods</hi> Caſe; nay of thoſe whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences have killed them with ſmiting, or provoked them ſo long and ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, till they kill'd themſelves; or thoſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42196:27"/>who leapt out of the flames of Conſcience into thoſe of Hell. Neither can I ſay that ſome who have been none of the greateſt Sinners, nor guilty of any enormous Crimes, have been kept a great while in the Furnace of a ſmiting Conſcience; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Mrs. <hi>Honywood</hi> aforeſaid: though or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily I do ſuppoſe it is the lot and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners of the firſt and ſecond rate to be ſo ſerved, rather than others; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thoſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>When thou with rebukes doth correct Man for Iniquity, thou makeſt his Beauty to conſume away like a Moth;</hi> as alſo thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. <hi>Thus ye ſpeak, ſaying, If our Tranſgreſſions and our Sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how ſhould we then live?</hi> Now Lord what ſhall we ſay to this, if the ſmitings of Conſcience be ſo ſharp, and the ſhorteſt of them be ſo long, compared with Humane Corrections; and even to be given not onely to Children but Malefactors: who can bear them long, <hi>and who can live when God does this?</hi> unleſs ſupported by that Arm which keeps even the damned in Hell alive?</p>
                  <p>We now proceed to the Seventh query, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Quando,</hi> namely, When or at what times it is, that Conſcience doth uſe to ſmitein reference to ſin? Whereto I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42196:28"/>Firſt of all, <hi>Many times before a ſin be committed,</hi> when Men have as yet but ſin in deliberation, or are but ſitting upon it, like the Cockatrice upon her Eggs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yet hatch'd nothing, and are yet but parling with the temptation, and liſtning to the tempter; even at that time of day, 'tis uſual with Conſcience to ſhoot off her <hi>Warning Piece,</hi> and to bid men take heed what they do; and to do by them as <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Wife did by him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.19. When he <hi>was ſate down on the Judgment Seat, ſent unto him, ſaying, Have thou nothing to do with that Juſt Man, for I have ſuffered many things concerning him in a Dream,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yea it is not unuſual with Conſcience to ſmite Men, meerly for parling with a temptation, or lending their ears more or leſs to the tempter; for looking at the bait, though they have not yet bit of it, much leſs received the hook into their mouths; and to give ſuch Counſel as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> doth, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 23.31. <hi>Look not thou upon the Wine when it is Red, when it giveth its Colour in the Cup; when it moveth it ſelf aright; at laſt it biteth like a Scrpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder.</hi> Thus in my Text, <hi>Davids Heart ſmote him,</hi> but for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Thought of Killing <hi>Saul</hi> (as ſome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42196:28"/>ſuppoſe he had done) or but for lending an ear to thoſe diſloyal Miſcreants, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled him ſo to do. Secondly, <hi>Conſcience ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſmites men</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in the very act of ſin;</hi> (as <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosby</hi> were ſmitten by another hand.) Thus while <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was carouſing <hi>in the Bowles of the Temple</hi> (which he ought not to have ſo prophaned) and probably debauched himſelf and his Nobles round about him; at that very inſtant <hi>appeared the Hand-writing upon the Wall,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. S5. <hi>Mene, Mene, Tekel, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pharſin,</hi> &amp;c. They are much miſtaken, who think that great ſins, if long ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are committed without great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret in the very doing of them: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience poures in Gall and Wormwood into the ſtollen Waters, which Men thought would have been altogether ſweet; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittering them in the very drinking of them, and mixeth <hi>Colliquintida,</hi> which is a very bitter thing, with that ſweet bread, (as men hope to find it) which is eaten in ſecret. Conſcience doth purpoſely diſturb and interupt the pleaſures of Sinners, and to ſpoil their ſport, doth as it were ſet a Deaths-Head by them, in the midſt of their Feaſting and Jollity; and doth caſt their Sins in their Diſhes, whilſt they are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42196:29"/>
                     <hi>Feeding without fear;</hi> and maketh them now and then to drink a <hi>Cup of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the wrath of God;</hi> and to be like the Citizens in <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Fables, Who whilſt they were Banqueting, are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſcared and affrighted with the noiſe in the Key-hole, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Creditor or Creditors came to attaque them.</p>
                  <p>Now Conſcience ſeems to do this, not onely to imbitter ſo much of the Sin as is paſt, but to make Men break off preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; like Souldiers quaffing and carouſing, when they hear the Drums and Trumpets of an approaching Enemy. <hi>David</hi> ſeems to have been approaching towards the Murthering of <hi>Saul,</hi> when he cut off his Skirt: It ſeems to imply he was trying what his Conſcience would permit him to do in that caſe; but bleſſed be God, he had ſuch a check from hs God and his Conſcience, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that, that he durſt proceed no farther.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, More eſpecially Conſcience is wont to ſmite Men after Sin committed, and that ſometimes ſooner, ſometimes later: I had almoſt compared Conſcience to an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer,</hi> who though he long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear his Money, when it is well ſecured, as by Motrgage of Houſe and Lands; yet at laſt will be ſure to call for <hi>Principal</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42196:29"/>and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> yea for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe;</hi> or to take the forfeiture of what is engaged for his ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>There are particular reaſons to be given why Conſcience ſometimes doth not ſmite men, either before the Commiſſion of a great Sin, or in the very Act, nor yet preſently after; but as ſure as Old Age will come upon Men (I mean the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it) if they live to be an hundred years Old; ſo certainly Conſcience will call Men to an account, if not in Health yet in Sickneſs; if not Living; yet Dying, yea if not dying ſo ſoon as they are Dead; for Conſcience is a King that never Dies: as they ſay in Law, <hi>Rex nunquam moritur:</hi> And they will find it in the next World, by the Name and Nature of a <hi>Never dying Worm;</hi> and as the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Nullum Tempus occurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t Regi.</hi> The Kings time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lapſeth. Some Men will find that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath not lapſed or loſt any time; like Creditors that loſe their Debts and Priviledge of ſuing for them, for want of demanding them within ſuch a term of years; but will recover all its Arrears. and ſue them till they have paid the uttermoſt farthing.</p>
                  <p>We proceed in the next place to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42196:30"/>Eighth Query, which I propoſed to ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Quomodo, Or how and in what manner it is thas Conſcience doth uſe to ſmite men for ſin?</hi> To which I anſwer, That Conſcience doth it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, at ſundry times, and in divers manners. Firſt of all, <hi>Conſcience doth ſometimes ſmite men very gently and eaſily;</hi> with light and ſoft touches, as Old <hi>Ely</hi> did his Sons; when he ſaid, <hi>It is not a good report which I hear of you my Sons; you make the Lords People to tranſgreſs;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. Chap. v. 24. It whips Men ſometimes as Mothers uſe to do their Infant Children, with a ſmall Twig and a ſoft hand, whereby they are rather ſcared than hurt: and toucheth them with that tenderneſs as one would touch the Apple of ones Eye.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, <hi>Conſcience doth many times correct Men ſmartly, ſmite them ſeverely, yet not ſo but that they are able to bear it;</hi> as you ſhall hear ſome Men ſay of thoſe fits of the Stone, Gout, or Collick, which they have felt, that they were very painful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but they thank God, ſuch as they were able to undergo, and but able. It is as much as ever ſome Men can do to bear that burthen of a wounded Conſcience, which lies upon them, but they make a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42196:30"/>hard ſhift, with much a-do rub along; a little more weight added to them, would ſink and over-whelm them: their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences correct them in full meaſure, though not above meaſure; and this it may be is the caſe of thouſands; their Conſciences give them their full <hi>Doſe,</hi> though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them not with a <hi>Hypercatharſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>But ſome there are</hi> (a caſe two frequent in the World, though not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as the former) <hi>whoſe Conſciences do ſmite them; Ad extremum viriuna, and lay on upon them with all their might;</hi> whoſe Conſcience thunder and lighten upon them, as God did upon the <hi>Iſraelites, from Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>Exodus</hi> 19.16. <hi>And it came to paſs that there were Thunder and Lightnings, and a thick Cloud upon the Mount, and the Voice of the Trumpet exceeding loud, ſo that all the People that was in the Camp trembled; and Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>was altogether on a Smoak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord deſcended upon it in Fire; the Smoak thereof aſcended as the Smoak of a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; and the whole Mount quaked greatly:</hi> With ſuch like Terrour, ſo far as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may imitate his Creator; ſo doth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſometimes cloath it ſelf: <hi>If a Beaſt doth but touch the Mountain</hi> (to allude to the paſſages at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) <hi>it is ſtoned or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42196:31"/>ſtruck through with a Dart, Heb.</hi> 12.20. I mean if a bruitiſh thought do but touch a mans mind, ſo terrible is the ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as aggravated by Conſcience, that he may ſay as <hi>Moſes</hi> 21. <hi>I exceedingly quake.</hi> Look with how grim a Countenance, and with how incens'd a Heart <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> lookt upon <hi>Haman,</hi> when coming out of his Garden, he found that proud Traytor fallen upon the Bed, where <hi>Heſter</hi> his Queen was; and ſaid of him, <hi>Will he force the Queen alſo before me in the Houſe?</hi> Heſter 7.8. With ſuch an aſpect, and with ſuch a rage doth Conſcience accoſt ſome Men; cauſe their Faces to be covered preſently with ſhame and confuſion: Doth it not fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Men like a Bear robbed of her Whelps, or like a Man under Jealouſie, upon him whom he ſuſpects? Of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is the rage of a Man, he will not ſpare in the day of his wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſcience ſeems ſometimes to vie with Death in the point of Terror, and to make it ſelf more a King of Terrors than he; for Sin is the ſting of Death, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is as it were the ſting of Sin. That Death is leſs terrible than an inraged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is manifeſt, becauſe thouſands fly or have fled from a purſuant Conſcience,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42196:31"/>to hide themſelves in <hi>the valley of the ſhadow of Death;</hi> and have choſen rather to fall into their own Bloody and Murtherous Hands, than to remain in the hands of Conſcience. How many purſued by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, have repaired to a Melancholly Beam (as one calls it) or any thing they could make a Gallows of, as it were to a City of Refuge, or to the Horns of an Altar, that is, <hi>have choſen ſtrangling rather than life.</hi> The Jews allow but Thirty nine Stripes to be given, even to Malefactors, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. But Conſcience will give Thouſands and Millions, fetching Blood at every ſtroak. Stone, Collick, Strangury, are the names of three little Tortures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that of a wounded and wounding Conſcience (for ſo it is that a wounded Conſcience will wound) if we wound it, it will wound us, that ever Gnawing Worm if we tread upon it will ſurely turn again. Nothing can make the Torment of <hi>Racking</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi> ſeem ſmall, but the greater Torment of a Tormenting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>All I have ſaid is eaſie to believe, if we but conſider ſome men have preferred Hell it ſelf before the ſmitings of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Conſcience; ſo <hi>Judas</hi> when <hi>he went
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42196:32"/>and hanged himſelf,</hi> though others it may be have been preverted from doing the ſame thing, chiefly by conſidering that what is ſaid of God, may as truly be ſaid of and to Conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>If I make my Bed in Hell behold thou art there.</hi> Some it may be fear that never dying Worm in Hell, more than the Fire and Brimſtone we read of, as ſuppoſing that the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Conſcience are all in all, as to the <hi>Pena ſenſus,</hi> or the poſitive Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the damned do there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.</p>
                  <p>Say not the Lion is not ſo terrible as he is Painted, or Conſcience as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it, for it alone can tell thee how terrible it is. Of it as of the great God, may be ſaid, <hi>Who knoweth the power of his wrath, according to his fear; ſo is his wrath.</hi> The terrors of Conſcience are as bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the extent of Fear, which is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that knows no limits. The Sea is bounded by Sands, but the dreads of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hardly by any thing; no <hi>Boanarges</hi> or Son of Thunder like to Conſcience; <hi>no high Court of Juſtice,</hi> nor yet of Injuſtice ſo terrible as that. Two Witneſſes ſerve in other Courts, Conſcience is a <hi>thouſand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> that which makes it more dreadful
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42196:32"/>is, In the Court of Conſcience a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a thouſand Witneſſes againſt himſelf, yea, a Man becomes that Judge that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Sentence of eternal Death on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. <hi>Yea, viz. Jews have put away the Goſpel from you and judged your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting Life.</hi> Were there ever a <hi>Francis Spiro</hi> in our days (as it is like ſome ſuch there are) he would tell you that all that I have ſaid of the terror of a ſmitting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, were but one half of what is true; yea, but a Flea-biting to what he himſelf had felt, <hi>that eye had never ſeen, ear heard, or it ever entered into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> how terrible the ſmitings of Conſcience ſometimes are; and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis ſaid that <hi>Deus &amp; Eternitas non patiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Hyperbolen, id eſt,</hi> that God and Eternity can admit of no <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> or cannot be out-languaged. The ſame may be truly ſaid of a Conſcience ſet upon ſmiting. I ſhall conclude this Head with thoſe words of <hi>Solomon, The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmities;</hi> but <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear,</hi> Prov. 18.14.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Come we now to ſpeak of the ninth and laſt Query propounded to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>(viz.) Quare, Why it is that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42196:33"/>doth ſmite men when they do, or have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt God?</hi> I anſwer, of that there are principally two reaſons to be given: firſt of all, <hi>becauſe God hath given Conſcience a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Commiſſion ſo to do;</hi> ſaying to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as to his Prophet of old, <hi>Lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, tell the people their tranſgreſſions.</hi> Conſcience is God's <hi>Attorney-General</hi> (if I may ſo call it) God's Advocate to plead for God againſt man, to exhibit God's Indictments againſt man, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth or ſhall require. Conſcience is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Gods <hi>Executioner,</hi> God's <hi>Lictor</hi> (if I may ſo call it) and therefore muſt ſmite when God bids it ſmite; it hath God's <hi>faſces,</hi> and <hi>ſecures,</hi> that is, God's Rods and Axes in his hands, and muſt not bear thoſe enſigns of Authority in vain, but do execution with them, as the great <hi>Conſul</hi> or <hi>Dictator</hi> of the world ſhall appoint. So much for the firſt reaſon. Secondly, The next is this, <hi>God hath every way fitted and framed Conſcience in its own fabrick, nature, and conſtitution, for ſuch a work as this,</hi> (viz.) <hi>to ſmite men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſin.</hi> Unto ſo doing it is conducted as it were by inſtinct from God, as is the Sun to know its due time of Riſing and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſeveral Creatures void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to know their proper ſeaſons:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42196:33"/>yea, things without life act according to that frame and make which <hi>Art</hi> hath given them: ſo Clocks do ſtrike, and Alarms go, and ſound at ſuch ſeaſons as they are made to do: But for ſmitings of Conſcience, there is further reaſon; for Conſcience is at once both a <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and a <hi>Judg,</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God ſo to be, and qualified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. As it is a <hi>Law</hi> of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſpeaking to the Gentiles) <hi>having not the Law, are a Law to themſelves;</hi> which law is Conſcience, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or Law written in their hearts: Now Conſcience as ſuch is by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines called <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> being a Store-houſe of Maxims and Principles, informing us of the <hi>Eternae &amp; indiſpenſabiles rationes boni &amp; mali,</hi> which Divines do ſo much ſpeak of, engraven with the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or common notions of good and evil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſcience is a witneſs, yea a thouſand witneſſes,</hi> as we learn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. by theſe words, <hi>which ſhow the works of the Law written in their hearts, their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Now as Conſcience is a witneſs, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines call it <hi>Syneideſis.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Conſcience is a Judg,</hi> and as ſuch is by Divines called
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42196:34"/>
                     <hi>Criſis:</hi> witneſs 1 John 3.20, 21. <hi>If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things: if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God:</hi> which words do ſhow Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be a <hi>Judg;</hi> for it is the office of a Judg to paſs ſentence either of <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Abſolution.</hi> Moreover, in thoſe words are intimated, that God hath given to Conſcience, as it were, <hi>the power of the Keys,</hi> and had ſaid unto it as unto <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whatever thou ſhalt bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou ſhalt looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now methinks I have to encounter with a very grand Objection; namely this, <hi>How can Conſcience be ſaid to be qualified as a reprover or ſmiter for ſin, ſith it ſometimes ſmites men for that which is no ſin? at other times when men do really ſin againſt God, it ſmites not at all, but rather applauds and commends them; as did the Conſcience of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>which told him he ought to do many things againſt Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth; and that it was true <hi>zeal in him to perſecute the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> Sith Conſcience ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puts darkneſs for light, and light for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42196:34"/>darkneſs; evil for good, and good for evil: what matter is it for its ſmitings, unleſs it were wiſer, and knew how at all turns never to <hi>juſtifie the wicked, and condemn the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Can it be, may ſome ſay, that God ſhould give a Commiſſion to Conſcience to ſmite thoſe which ought not to be ſmitten, or to chide thoſe which ought rather to be comforted, or to comfort and commend thoſe who ought rather to be ſoundly chid and condemned. If Conſcience trifle at this rate, may ſome ſay, ought it not to be ſlighted like a perfidious Jury, that brings in thoſe guilty that are not guilty, and thoſe not guilty that are guilty. This Objection ſeems to ſtand like a Mountain, if not like Mount <hi>Sion</hi> it ſelf, which can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; yet wait but a while, you may ſee it made a Plane, if not turned into a Valley. I premiſe a word or two by way of Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; namely, that Conſcience in this corrupt degenerate eſtate of all humane faculties, doth ſometimes miſtake comforting thoſe which it ought to chide, and chiding thoſe whom it ought to comfort: but thanks be to God, there is a way to prevent thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes. Time was when Conſcience might have ſerv'd as a Law to us, and of it ſelf, a kind of <hi>regula pure regulans:</hi> But now it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42196:35"/>is <hi>a regula regulata,</hi> (viz.) <hi>a rule to be ruled by the word of God;</hi> which is to Conſcience <hi>as a light ſhining in a dark place;</hi> to which the Conſciences of men ought to take heed as to that which is <hi>a light to their feet, and a lanthorn to their paths.</hi> There is a crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which hath happened in part to the Conſciences of men by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, and their fall in him, but is ſuch as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, or made ſtreight, by attending to the word of God; as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>A young man may cleanſe his way by taking heed to Gods Word.</hi> Look how a raw and unskilful <hi>Compoſer</hi> may do well enough, if he ſhall but follow the advice of an able and careful <hi>Corrector of the Preſs;</hi> ſo may the Conſciences of men produce a correct edition of their lives, if they make but ſuch amendments as the word of God doth direct. Far be it from us to charge the holy God ſo fooliſhly, as if he did ſuborn and inſtigate the Conſciences of men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for what they ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, or to commend them for what they ought to be condemned: for ſhall <hi>not the judg of all the earth do righteouſly? is not Jehovah a God that cannot lye?</hi> This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, it muſt needs be ſaid, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, doth, or can give to Conſcience, a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42196:35"/>
                     <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> or command, to ſmite when it ought not to ſmite, or to ſtrike when it ought rather to ſmile upon us: but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give ſuch a <hi>permiſſion</hi> as that to the Conſciences of men, and leaves them (as he is free to do) to miſ-repreſent things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their corrupt and perverſe incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                  <p>That paſſage in the firſt of <hi>Kings</hi> 22.22. which ſeemeth of all other Texts, moſt pregnant to prove that God Almighty doth ſometimes give forth his command and commiſſion to inſtruments, to do that which is evil, as namely to lye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be found upon due examination to ſignifie juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that purpoſe: the words are theſe, <hi>And the evil ſpirit ſaid, I will go forth, and I will be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his,</hi> that is, of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets: <hi>And</hi> (he that is the Lord) ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt perſwade and prevail alſo; go forth and do ſo.</hi> But upon due ſearch it will be found that thoſe words of God <hi>(go forth and do ſo)</hi> are not words of command, and Commiſſion, but a bare permiſſion, and ſufferance; like thoſe words of our Saviour to <hi>Judas,</hi> John 13.27. <hi>And after the ſop Satan entered into him, That thou doeſt, do quickly.</hi> As if he had ſaid, now the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42196:36"/>fulneſs of time is at hand, in which the Son of man is to be betrayed, I will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee, but ſuffer thee to do what I know is in thy heart to do as ſoon as thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt. Again, I ſay the words forecited, Go, and do ſo, ſignifie no more than did the words of Chriſt to the Devils who beſought him to ſuffer them to go into the Herd of Swine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.31. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, go,</hi> ver. 32. that is not <hi>I command</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, but <hi>I permit</hi> and ſuffer you to do. Moreover, it is to be noted, that ſo the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language doth often put the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> Mood for the <hi>Future</hi> Tenſe; as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Keep my Commandments and live:</hi> where <hi>vive</hi> is put for <hi>vives, live</hi> inſtead of <hi>thou ſhalt live.</hi> So <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Forſake the fooliſh and live</hi> (that is, and thou ſhalt live) of which there are many more inſtances in the holy Scriptures. In like manner the words, <hi>go forth and do ſo,</hi> in the Text I am explaining, ſignifie no more but this, I will not be thy hindrance, if thou wilt thou ſhalt for me; thou ſhalt have my permiſſion to go forth and do ſo.</p>
                  <p>By what I have ſaid, it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that unleſs God were bound, as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is not, to hinder all the ſin, that is, or ever was, or ever ſhall be poſſible for him to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42196:36"/>hinder, that is, all ſin that ever was or ſhall be in the world, there is no fault to be charged upon God for permitting, and but barely permitting the degenerate purblind Conſciences of men, like <hi>Ahab</hi>'s falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to delude and deceive them. When the Conſciences of men have defiled and debauched themſelves, it is at Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and liberty whether hewill, or will not reſtore and rectifie them. However this may ſerve for ever to ſtop the mouths of men, that though their Conſciences in this fallen ſtate be not a light ſufficient to guide them in all their ways, that they turn not aſide from God more or leſs, to the right or to the left hand, yet God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven another auxiliary or ſupplemental light, if I may ſo call it <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which are ſaid to be <hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſh'd unto all good works.</hi> For as man could not plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance after that God had given him the Ten Commandments, written in Tables of Stone, though he had defaced the Law which was at firſt written in his heart, this new editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law in Tables of Stone, reſtoring to him what was obliterated in the ſtony
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42196:37"/>table of his heart: ſo neither now, can men plead excuſe for their ſins, from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directings of their Conſciences: ſith, God hath given his holy Word, as it were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Conſcience</hi> and guide to men, to ſhow them the way, in the which they ought to walk, and to pleaſe God. What if the torch of natural light or Conſcience hath been well nigh blown out, ſo long as there are the Sun Beams of Divine Revelation contracted in the holy Scriptures, as in a Burning-glaſs wherewith to light it again? Put <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> together, and where they two meet, there's light enough to make a mans way plain to heaven; and if he will but mind his <hi>Compaſs,</hi> to bring him ſafe to the port of everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So I have done with the doctrinal part of the firſt doctrine <hi>(viz.)</hi> that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a ſmiter, or a thing that will ſmite men firſt or laſt, if they give occaſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this diſcousſe with a few <hi>Corolaries</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi> Uſe 1. <hi>Then God hath not left himſelf without a witneſs</hi> in the breaſts of men, nor men without warning. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Conſcience witneſſeth for God and againſt men; other times Conſcience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth for men, and with God; ſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>The Spirit of God witneſſeth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42196:37"/>with our ſpirits that we are the children of God.</hi> Conſcience is <hi>Gods Ambaſſador,</hi> lying leager in the ſouls of men, by which God is wont to give men notice, when he is <hi>whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſword, bending his bow, making ready his arrow upon the ſtring, and preparing for them inſtruments of death if they turn not,</hi> as in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7.12. God doth not uſually ſurprize men, or come upon them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, before ſuch time as he hath ſhot off his warning-piece. <hi>Nineveh</hi> had notice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it by the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> of its approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ruine, if Repentance prevented not. God by the preaching of <hi>Noah</hi> warn'd the old world of that Flood which did await it, and was to fall upon it not till a hundred and twenty years after. God would have men forewarned that they might be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. <hi>Thus will I do unto thee, O Iſrael; and becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens that he may not ſmite, wiſhing rather to <hi>ſcare</hi> men than to <hi>hurt</hi> them, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Conſcience to ſmite them, that if that will ſerve the turn, he may hold his hand; for it is better to fall into the hand of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, than into the hand of God. If God had not ſuch a witneſs as Conſcience is, how could he convict men at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42196:38"/>of ſecret ſins, as the Text ſaith, God will bring every ſecret thing to light, whether it be good or whether it be evil; and in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.5. is ſaid, <hi>God will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs and make manifeſt the counſels of the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What but Conſcience can witneſs againſt Men at the day of Judgment; their Heart Murthers, Heart Adulteries; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid to <hi>Shimei,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.44. <hi>Thou knoweſt all the wickedneſs which thy Heart is privy to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Conſcience is ſuch a witneſs as none can withſtand or deny its teſtimony. If two credible witneſſes are ſufficient even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life and Death, much more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which is a thouſand witneſſes: Hence it is that we read of him, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Wedding Feaſt, without a Wedding Garment; that when the King ſaid unto him, <hi>Friend. How cameſt thou in hither, not having a Wedding Garment? he was ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; Matth.</hi> 22.12. Hence alſo we read of, <hi>Every Mouth being ſtopt, and all the World becoming guilty before God; Rom.</hi> 3.19. Hence it was that no reply was made to our Saviour, when he ſaid, <hi>He that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> without ſin, let him caſt the firſt ſtone at her;</hi> for the Text ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 8.9. <hi>They which heard it, being convicted in their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, went out one by one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42196:38"/>
                  <p>Now whereas ſome are brought in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus for themſelves, at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>When did we ſee thee Hungry and fed thee not, Naked and clothed thee not, Sick, and in Priſon, and did not adminiſter unto thee? Matth.</hi> 25.44. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew not that which Chriſt tells them of; in the next verſe, <hi>In as much as you did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, you did it not to me.</hi> If their Conſciences had been ſooner convicted of their unkindneſs to their Saviour; expreſſed in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs to his Diſciples and Followers; they would not have had one word to ſay for themſelves, or preſumed to open their Mouths.</p>
                  <p>It can never be doubted whether the Meſſage were left with thoſe Perſons, whom Conſcience was appointed to warn; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Conſcience alwayes ſpeaks with the Parties themſelves, and leaves its errand in their own Breaſts: Indeed when Chriſt ſhall come to judge the World, it is ſaid, <hi>He will come like a Thief in the night.</hi> Yea when God comes to ruine Perſons or Nations, after fair warnings given, but never taken, he oft-times doth it ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Hence <hi>Deſtruction is ſaid to come as a whirlwind, or as ſorrow up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42196:39"/>who are ſometimes never better at eaſe, or more light-ſome or cheerful, than juſt before their Pains: hence thoſe words of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reproved, hardeneth his Neck, ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy:</hi> There we read indeed of ſudden deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but of frequent reproof going before it. Now Conſcience is the great <hi>Reprover,</hi> and a man is never throughly convicted as to himſelf, till he be ſo of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; ſo I have done with the firſt uſe. Second <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> The next Uſe or Corollary is this, <hi>If Conſcience be ſuch a Smiter,</hi> as hath been ſhewed, <hi>then it is no argument that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſcape ſcot-free, or go unpuniſhed; becauſe their ſins do not go before to Judgment, that is, are kept ſecret from men;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exempted from Humane Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Pain, and Shame; becauſe it is Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment enough, God wot, for a Man to <hi>run the Gantlet,</hi> and undergo the <hi>Rack</hi> of his own Conſcience: If God ſhall but ſay, take him Conſcience, take him by the Throat, clap Irons upon him, throw him in thy Dungeon, feed him with the Bread of Spiritual Affliction, and give him thoſe Waters to drink, which are more bitter than the Waters of <hi>Marah.</hi> If the great

If ſuch a ſentence as that ſhall come forth from the great God, he upon whom it is paſt, needs no Poverty, no loſs of near and dear Relations, no Bodily Sickneſs or Pain; no Temporal Priſon, no Reproach or Diſgrace from Men to make him miſerable; nay he ſhall be ſo in ſpight of Riches, Honour, Power, the beſt of Wives and Children, the kindeſt of Relations and Friends, and what ever elſe this World can give him; he ſhall tremble, as did <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> even when quaffing and carouzing with all his Friends about him; he ſhall fit Uneaſie, and as it were upon Thorns, though he ſit upon a Throne with his Crown on his Head, and his Scepter in his Hand; and Thouſands of Nobles ſtanding bare before him: he ſhall not be heartily merry, though upon his Wedding day, nor at the Birth and Baptizing of a brave Son, long deſired; nor at a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

God knows, if Conſcience be wounded, a Man can poſſeſs no <hi>Mirth,</hi> but what is rather to be called <hi>Madneſs;</hi> or like the Laughter, or Dancing of thoſe who are ſtung with a <hi>Tarantula;</hi> and let the Beaſt or Beaſtial part of Man be never ſo Brisk and Jocond, that which is properly called the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> The Humane rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal <hi>Soul</hi> or Spirit of a Man, <hi>intermeddles not with its joys;</hi> which makes me think of the Apoſtles words, <hi>The Widow which liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Pleaſure is Dead while ſhe lives;</hi> for what is Death but a ſeparation of Soul and Body? and in this caſe Soul and Body are ſeparated; for her animated Body hath Pleaſure, but her Soul hath none.</p>
                  <p>Reader, If thou hadſt ever known what the ſmitings of Conſcience mean, I need not tell thee that they are ſufficient to give a man a very Hell upon Earth, whilſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42196:40"/>they who behold his outward Proſperity, not knowing where the Shooe pinches him, do think him as it were in Heaven (if there be any ſuch thing as Heaven upon Earth.) So I have done with the ſecond <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is this, If Conſcience be ſo great and terrible a ſmiter, it muſt needs be great folly in Men, needleſly to provoke and inrage it (as too many do)</hi> from day to day; for there are a ſort of Men, of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Who are wont to tranſgreſs without a cauſe, Pſal.</hi> 25.3. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, who were his <hi>Enemies without a cauſe, Pſal.</hi> 7. <hi>and without Cauſe had hid their net for him in a Pit; which without cauſe they digged for him; Pſal.</hi> 35.7. May it not be ſaid of ſome, that they are Enemies to God, and to the Peace of their own Minds, by making work for Conſcience, and for Repentance, without any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable cauſe: Of this ſort are thoſe, who abound in needleſs Oaths and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, crying at every turn, I will be hang'd if this or that be not ſo. Yea, here and there you have a Monſter of a Man, that fears not upon every ſlight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to cry, <hi>God damn me,</hi> as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his maker; and ſcorned that <hi>Tophet which was prepared of old,</hi> for ſuch as he;

                     <hi>which God hath made deep and large; the Pile whereof is much Wood, and the Breath of the Lord like a ſtream of Brimſtone doth kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it, Iſa.</hi> 30.33. Or as if they could cheerfully <hi>drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out with mixture into the Cup of his Indignation;</hi> and endure to be <hi>tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lamb; and to have the ſmoak of their torment aſcending for ever, and ever, and to have no reſt day nor night; Rev.</hi> 14.10, 11. Or as if when the queſtion is put, <hi>Who can dwell with the conſuming Fire, who can dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</hi> as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>they could roundly anſwer; That can we do:</hi> If ſo, they have ſtouter hearts than ſinners in old time were wont to have; for the Text ſaith, <hi>The ſinners in</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypocrites, ſaying, Who ſhall dwell with devouring Fire,</hi> &amp;c. Methinks I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble theſe Perſons to nothing ſo much as to the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> ſpoken of 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.28. of whom it is ſaid, <hi>They cried aloud, and cut themſelves after their manner, with Knives and Launces, till the Blood guiſhed out upon them.</hi> Many who laugh at the Papiſt for whipping themſelves

                  <p>Lord I can but think, how theſe men will look when Conſcience ſhall come to reckon with them, and they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not able to anſwer it one of a thouſand? I can but think how pale they will look, or rather how black in the Face with fear and aſtoniſhment: what a dreadful eccho thoſe Oaths and bloody Curſes will have in Mens Ears when they come to be reſounded upon a Sick-bed or Death-bed: Or rather in what a pickle thoſe men will be <hi>when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God and obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and they ſee themſelves <hi>puniſhed with everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8, 9. If it be ſo terrible as it is, to hear but a zealous Miniſter, warmly diſcourſing of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42196:42"/>Torments of Hell, eſpecially if a Mans Conſcience at the ſame time ſecond what he ſaith, and joyn iſſue with the Preacher, as did the Conſcience of <hi>Felix,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. <hi>That when</hi> Paul <hi>reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> Felix <hi>trembled:</hi> I ſay, if the bare hearing of Hell be ſo terrible, as to make a Heathen Judge, upon the Bench, tremble at the words of his poor Priſoner at the Bar, ſtanding there to await his Sentence; how intollerable will it be to feel ſuch things? And who can chuſe, when in the midſt of thoſe Flames, but cry out, as did the <hi>Sinners and Hypocrites in</hi> Zion; <hi>Who can dwell with devouring Fire? Who can dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</hi> You would be loath conſtantly to ſit under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> that would be alwayes thundring and lightning; preaching of Hell and Damnation; flaſhing Hell-fire in your Faces, with every Sermon, as if Mount <hi>Sinah</hi> were his Pulpit; but were your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſuch, you could make a ſhift and an excuſe to go out of the Church, as oft as he came to his uſe of terrour; and ſtay out of his way till the ſtorm were over; but if you provoke your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and make them <hi>burning</hi> as well as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42196:42"/>
                     <hi>ſhining Lights</hi> within you (as that phraſe may be taken) whether will you fly from thoſe flames, and whereunto will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelves? Go whither you will Conſcience will follow you, and if you have Ears to hear will make you hear, yea will find you Ears, if you make as if you had none; yea, ſpeak loud enough to be heard, though you were almoſt dead, or were diſpoſed to turn a deaf Ear upon it.</p>
                  <p>Conſcience will have acceſs to you at all hours, even in the dead and ſtill of the night; it will come ſtealing upon you like a Thief in the night: nay, that it need not do neither, for it will make bold with greateſt noiſe to burſt your Iron Bars, break open your Doors, and make a loud and forcible entrance upon you, when it pleaſes, and look upon it ſelf to be always at home when it is where you are; yea to be Maſter of the Houſe, and to have full authority to ſpeak and do within your Breaſts what it liſteth: Conſcience is as it were every Mans Chamberlain, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the Key of every Mans Breaſt, as it were, at his Girdle, and therefore can go or get into a Man when it pleaſeth; and if they do, as it were, bolt or bar the Door on the inſide, it is able to make even Braſs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42196:43"/>or Iron Grates, to fly open before it; for nothing can keep Conſcience out. Now Conſcience being ſuch a thing as I have deſcribed, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>viz. He that paſſeth by and medleth with ſtrife, that belongeth not to him, is like one that taketh a Dog by the Ears;</hi> may be applied to Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it muſt needs be folly and madneſs in any Man, needleſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Conſcience, and without great cauſe and temptation to make work for it; as he were mad that would rouze up a ſleepy Lion or Maſtiff, when he had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſo to do. So much ſhall ſerve for the 3. <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſhall be this, <hi>Sith it is the office of Conſcience to ſmite Men, as in reference to ſin, it muſt needs behove us to keep our Conſciences alwayes in ſmiting caſe; I do not mean to give them cauſe to ſmite us, for that we ſhould by no means do; but to keep them in an aptitude and fitneſs to ſmite us when juſt cauſe is given.</hi> What is a Dog good for, if he will not ſo much as bark? Or what does a Sword ſignifie if it be ruſty and has loſt all its edge? Chyrurgeons can asill ſpare their ſmarting as their healing Plaiſters; becauſe proud Fleſh muſt be taken off by Corroſives. Give me a Fever ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Lethargy, ſith it is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42196:43"/>of Phyſicians to cure Men of Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies by caſting them into Fevers: It is better to be bliſtered than ſtupified, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Epiſpaſtick</hi> Plaiſters are applied when ſtupefaction is feared, but eſpecially when incumbent. Let my Conſcience rather raiſe Bliſters on me from Head to Foot, than ſuffer me to fall into a dead ſleep of Security, and fall into Hell in a Golden Dream of Heaven and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now that Conſcience may be in ſmite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſe, as the matter ſhall require, and have that ſharp edge which is due to it, take the following directions:</p>
                  <p>Dir. 1. <hi>Keep the Eye of Conſcience alwayes open and clear, that it may be able to ſee when cauſe is given to ſmite.</hi> The will indeed is <hi>Coeca potentia,</hi> a blind faculty, truly ſo called; and if not led by the underſtanding, will fall into many a Ditch; hence 'tis commonly ſaid, that <hi>Voluntas ſequitur ultimum dictamen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus practici.</hi> But as for the Conſcience, that to be ſure ought to be no blind facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for that is underſtanding it ſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, <hi>Intellectus practicus;</hi> it does belong to it not to be led, but to lead; it is the very eye of a Soul, I had almoſt ſaid the very Apple of its Eye: therefore let not ſo much as a Mote get into it, to dim and obſcure it.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42196:44"/>
                  <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Keep alwayes a tenderneſs upon thy Conſcience, though not a perplexing ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs.</hi> What ſaid God to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19. <hi>Becauſe thine heart was tender, I alſo have heard thee; ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. A tender Conſcience is ſoon wounded, and a Conſcience that is wounded will certainly wound and ſmite. Conſcience of all things is not to be expoſed to hardſhip; for what Divines ſay of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Spiritus Dei eſtres delicatula.</hi> That he is a tender thing ſoon grieved and quenched. The ſame in its meaſure may be ſaid of Conſcience, it is a moſt tender thing. 'Tis preternatural, when thoſe parts of the Body that ought to be ſoft and tender, become hard and callous; as when a Mans Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys become petrified and turned into meer Stones; ſo it is when the heart of a Man becomes <hi>a heart of ſtone,</hi> which ought to be <hi>a Heart of Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Labour to eſcape the frequent and more fervent ſmitings of Conſcience, for by means of them it is, that the hearts of Men become perfectly hardned.</hi> Juſt like School-Boys, who having often felt the ſmart of the Rod or Ferula, and are feeling of it from day to day, are wont to deſpiſe thoſe Corrections, and to become Rod and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42196:44"/>
                  <p>Direct. 4. <hi>Encourage Conſcience to ſmite thee by mending upon it as often as it tells thee thy faults;</hi> remembring that paſſage, Job 34.31, 32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any more; that which I ſee not, teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> Conſcience will have little heart to ſmite a man any more, but rather conſent that he be <hi>reſerved to the day of Judgment to be puniſhed, if when ſmitten, he revolt more and more;</hi> and if he be not manifeſtly worſe, is not one jot the better for all its ſmitings.</p>
                  <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Be much in contemplation of Death and Judgment, and of the world to come;</hi> or if thou wilt, of the <hi>quatuor noviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima, or the four laſt things,</hi> viz. <hi>Death, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> for they are as it were the four wheels which draw the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of Conſcience; and when they or any of them is quite taken off, Conſcience draws but heavily. Commend me to the good man that ſaid, <hi>I bleſs God I carry my dying thoughts always about me, and do uſe to try my moſt ſolemn enterpriſes by the touch-ſtone of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Will this or that give me comfort when I come to die?</hi> How will Conſcience look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this or that, through the perſpective of Death and approaching Judgment? To
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42196:45"/>think often of our dying, and coming to judgment, is an excellent way to keep our Conſciences alive and awake, and in ſmiting caſe; ſo I have done with the 5. Direction and 4. Uſe. The 5. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> or Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary is this, <hi>Sith Conſcience is ſo terrible a Smiter, and ſo like to the Hand and Rod of</hi> Moſes, <hi>which could fetch Water out of a Rock</hi> (as has been ſhewed) <hi>it behoves every Man to ſtand in Awe of his own Conſcience,</hi> and to take that advice as in reference to God himſelf, <hi>viz.

Sure I am, There is no part of a Mans ſelf, which he ought more, or yet ſo much to dread, as his Conſcience: But for Conſcience, no one faculty in the Soul of Man would be terrible to him, nor yet all his faculties put together, but Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence infuſeth terrour into every one of them. Who could not look upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter</hi> of his <hi>Memory</hi> without any trouble or fear, were it not that <hi>Conſcience</hi> did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reflect upon the evil action therein regiſtred? Who could not exerciſe his <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative underſtanding,</hi> in contemplating the worſt things he hath done, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42196:45"/>or remorſe, were it not that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>Practical Intellect,</hi> did make ſuch terrible uſe of them? Who could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport himſelf with his Fantaſie and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and pleaſantly act over all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer enormities upon that ſtage; were it not for Conſcience, that is apt to ſpoil the Sport, to look a Man out of Countenance, and to ſpeak to him in thoſe words of <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce, O Young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the days of thy Youth, and walk in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment.</hi> They had wont to ſay, <hi>Cave Cato videt.</hi> Take heed <hi>Cato</hi> ſees you. But I ſay, <hi>Cave Conſcientia videt.</hi> Take heed <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſees you; get out of Conſciences ſight if you can and do your worſt; but I had almoſt ſaid, you may as eaſily fly from God himſelf, who is <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,</hi> as from Conſcience, which is Gods Deputy; though it be not every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as God is, and preſent to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as God is, yet it is preſent to every Mans ſelf; and I was about to ſay of it, in reference to every Mans Soul, as is ſaid of the Soul in reference to the Body; that <hi>Conſcientia eſt tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42196:46"/>parte.</hi> That is, Intirely in all and every part and faculty of the Soul. Say often to thy ſelf, It is more to me, that my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is privy to what I do, though all the World beſides be ignorant of it, than if all the World beſides knew it, and my own Conſcience knew nothing of it; for if Conſcience be diſpoſed to take vengeance on me, and to call me to a ſtrict account for what I have done; I know it can create puniſhments for me beyond all that men can inflict, or that can be inflicted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands ſave his, <hi>who is able to caſt Soul and Body into Hell Fire;</hi> and in that regard is the onely Perſon whom I ought to dread and reverence more than my own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for as <hi>Self Murther</hi> is the worſt and cruelleſt of all Murthers, ſo Self-ſmitings (and what are they but reflections of Conſcience) are the terribleſt of all ſmite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They are thoſe <hi>Arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty that ſtick in Mens hearts, and the venom thereof drinketh up their Spirits.</hi> What pity is it, that many men never learn to fear themſelves enough till they come to feel themſelves ſo ſharp upon, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to themſelves, that they can bear it no longer; that they ſeem a greater Hell to themſelves than Hell it ſelf would be:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42196:46"/>(which was <hi>Spira</hi>'s caſe.) It is one good anſwer wherewith to ſtop the mouth of the tempter, <hi>How can I do this wickedneſs and ſin againſt my own Conſcience?</hi> How can I look my Conſcience in the face if I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with ſuch a temptation; or rather how dreadfully will Conſcience ſtare me in the face when I have done it? I had rather diſpleaſe the whole World than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe that part of my ſelf, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Conſcience; for if that once be angry and continue ſo, I ſhall have no joy in my Life; all my comforts will be imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; it will give me for <hi>Beauty Aſhes,</hi> for the <hi>Oyl of Joy, Mourning;</hi> for the <hi>Garment of Praiſe, the Spirit of Heavineſs;</hi> it will be <hi>Colloquintida,</hi> or Death in the pot of all my Injoyments: They feel Conſcience leaſt who fear it moſt; and they who in one ſenſe are moſt afraid of Conſcience, are uſually leaſt hurt by it (as Parents love not to ſtrike thoſe Children, whom they can ſufficiently over-awe and deter from miſ-doing without ſtriking them.) So I have done with the 5. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> ſhall be this: <hi>Sith Conſcience is ſo dreadful a Smiter, it muſt needs be every mans concern to maintain Peace, Amity, and a good Correſpondence with his own Conſcience;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42196:47"/>that it may either not ſmite him at all, or in meaſure, ſo as he may be able to bear it; ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>its rough Wind in the day of the Eaſt-wind; not thraſhing out the Fitches with a thraſhing Inſtrument, nor turning about the Cart Wheel upon the Cummin, but beating out the Fitches with a Staff, and the Cummin with the Rod:</hi> To allude to what is ſaid of God, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28.27. <hi>Correct him but in meaſure, though it leave him not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unpuniſhed;</hi> as God promiſed his People; <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11: School Boys who have Maſters eminently ſevere, are concerned to make as few faults as ever they can, and to pleaſe them as much as ever lies in their power, as ever they hope to ſleep in a whole skin: ſuch a Maſter is Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if it ſet on.</p>
                  <p>Now the way to give it content, and to keep it quiet with us, is as followeth:</p>
                  <p>Direct 1. <hi>See that Conſcience it ſelf be well adviſed and informed, like a Jury that have received full inſtructions from the Judge; elſe it may chance to chide us ſometimes upon pure miſtake, as the weakeſt People are uſually the moſt querulous.</hi> What ſerves the Word of God for, what more proper uſe can be made, of pious and able Miniſters, of our acquantance with Judicious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42196:47"/>Chriſtians, than that by the help of all theſe our Conſciences might be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the way of truth? Neither is it eaſie for us to imagine, that in caſe we did uſe all theſe means to inform our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences aright, that God would ſuffer them to err in any great and dangerous inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Direct. 2. <hi>When we have got our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences well adviſed, our next buſineſs ſhould be to conſult and adviſe with our Conſciences.</hi> When Conſcience hath heard what God hath to ſay to it, we ſhould hear what Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had to ſay to us: As God gave his Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> to his People, ſo God ſpeaks firſt to Conſcience, or gives his Law to Conſcience; and Conſcience in Gods Name gives Law to us: If we pay not that reſpect to our Conſciences to conſult with them, they will never be at peace with us, but think themſelves ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and affronted: Conſcience expects that every Man ſhould ſay to it, <hi>By your leave, and may it ſtand with your good liking;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he enterpriſeth any matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. When a Man hath any thing in deſign, the firſt queſtion to be asked, is, <hi>Is it lawful to be done?</hi> And of whom ſhould a Man ask that but of his Conſcience,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42196:48"/>leaving thar to inform it ſelf the beſt it can, by all the wayes and means afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: For as God took it ill when the <hi>Iſraelites ſate down to eat and drink with the Gibeonites, and asked not Counſel of the Lord:</hi> So will Conſcience when we do any thing of importance, and do not firſt ask its Counſel, and repair to it as to an Oracle.</p>
                  <p>Direct. 3. <hi>If thou wouldſt not have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſmite thee, then when Conſcience is yet in doubt and ſuſpence, be thou in ſuſpence alſo; ſuſpend acting till Conſcience become reſolved:</hi> according to that good old ſaying, <hi>Quod dubitas, ne facias.</hi> Remembring the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Words, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith; for whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, Rom.</hi> 14.23. As alſo the Exhortation which the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle giveth; v. 5. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded or aſſured in his own mind:</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the lawfulneſs of that which he taketh in hand. He that would maintain peace and friendſhip betwixt Conſcience and himſelf, or rather that would have his Conſcience <hi>good friends</hi> with him; let him await the full reſolution and ſatisfaction of Conſcience before he preſumes to act.</p>
                  <p>Direct. 4. <hi>He that would eſcape the ſevere ſtroaks and ſmitings of Conſcience, let him
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42196:48"/>take heed of doing any thing contrary to the expreſs distates and commands of thereof; of going (if I may ſo expreſs it) to</hi> Tarſhiſh, <hi>as did</hi> Jonah, <hi>when Conſcience would ſend him to</hi> Nineveh; of going to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> when the Commiſſion which he hath received is for the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Conſcience is very impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of being contradicted; and that Men and Women ſhould proceed point blank, contrary to its Counſel and Command. Next to that indignation wherewith you may imagine the great God reſented it, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old made this ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born reply to his Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Jer.</hi> 44.16. <hi>viz. As for the Word that thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee, but we will certainly do whatſoever thing goes forth out of our own Mouth; to burn Incenſe unto the Queen of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. You may conceive that indignation to be wherewith Conſcience reſents it; when any Man ſaith to it, either in words or in effect, As for what thou haſt ſpoken to me in the Name of the Lord, I will not do it; but whatſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of my own Heart and Mouth, that will I do. The day is yet to come, in which Conſcience ever did, or ever will ſpeak peace to thoſe that are in flat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42196:49"/>againſt it: and as the Text ſaith, <hi>Had</hi> Zimri <hi>peace who ſlew his Maſter?</hi> So may it be ſaid, Had ever any Man peace whilſt he was in actual Arms and Hoſtility againſt his Conſcience? No, no, The way to peace and tranquility of Mind, is to do nothing but by full and free leave and conſent of our well informed Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Direct. 5. <hi>If thou wouldſt ſhun the ſmite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Conſcience, being ſo terrible as thou haſt heard they are; give thy Conſcience the preferrence and preheminence above all other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of thy Soul; yea above all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures intereſt and conſiderations whatſoever.</hi> The intereſt of God and Conſcience is one and the ſame; and therefore that Intereſt ſhould take place of all others. Say not my <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> nor yet my <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Profit,</hi> nor <hi>Honour,</hi> do incline or invite me, this or that way: If Conſcience ſuggeſt other things, and ſay, O do not that thing whereto thy will and affections are ſo much inclined, or thou ſo much tempted by thy worldly intereſt: for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is more than all the reſt. All other Sheaves ought to bow to the Sheave of Conſcience; to allude to what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, and as it were tipified, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Joſeph and his Brethren; that they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42196:49"/>ſhould be ſubject to him.</hi> We have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>My Mind to me a Kingdom is:</hi> To be ſure every Mans Conſcience is his Kingdom. So long as any Man holds the poſſeſſion of a good and unvanquiſhed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he may be ſaid to be in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for ſurely among thoſe Kings of whom God ſaith, <hi>By me Kings Reign;</hi> Conſcience is one <hi>Dejure;</hi> and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>Tyrany</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> in his Soul, who ſuffers any other Creature to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, or any being, but he that is <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords:</hi> One ſaith well, <hi>That Peace is every thing in Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> and that there is not rue Peace but where it is ſo: you may therefore conclude that where the ſoveraignty of Conſcience, next and immediately under the great God, is not owned and ſubmitted to, there can be no Peace; for ſo long as Conſcience can hold a Scepter in his Hand, he will ſmite all ſuch Perſons, or do what is worſe.</p>
                  <p>Direct. 6. <hi>If thou wouldſt diſable COnſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ſmiting or arreſting thee, labour alwayes to carry a pardon about thee, ſigned and ſealed with the Blood of Jeſus:</hi> have thy Diſcharge and Acquittance from the great God, alwayes in readineſs to produce; then mayeſt thou preſently ſtop the mouth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42196:50"/>of Conſcience if it begin to accuſe thee with ſuch words as thoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, it is God that juſtifieth; who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died; nay, rather that is riſen again,</hi> &amp;c. Then may you ſay, uſing the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>And ſuch</hi> (meaning ſuch great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) <hi>were ſome of you: but you are waſhed, but you are ſanctified, but you are juſtified in the Name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Thou mayeſt build upon it, that a well informed Conſcience will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſmite thee, ſo as to do thee any great hurt, if thou canſt but ſincerely ſay of thy ſelf what Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith of himſelf;</hi> Acts 24.16. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have alwayes a Conſcience void of offence towards God and towards Man.</hi> Nay let me tell you, the fore-going Directions, well obſerved and practiſed, will not onely prevent the ſtripes and ſmitings of Conſcience, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo procure the ſmiles thereof, and cauſe it to ſpeak to thee in ſuch Language, as the great Judge will to all true believers, at the great day, ſaying, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>

                  <head>The Second Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <p>NOw Reader if thou art only for <hi>Practical Divinity,</hi> ſtop here and go no further; for I confeſs to thee what remains will be partly <hi>Polemical,</hi> partly <hi>Political;</hi> being ſuch as the ſolemnity of the 30th <hi>day of January,</hi> and the occaſion of the Faſt of that day doth call for: For methinks, if I may preſume to know the Whiſpers of Mens Hearts, I hear ſome prejudiced Perſons object and ſay, <hi>What cauſe hath any Mans Conſcience to ſmite him for having been concerned in the Death of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt? Why is he called a Martyr? or why his Judges called Murtherers?</hi> So many of them as died up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of that Fact?</p>
                  <p>Now why ſhould I be thought uncharitable, for imagining this to be the lauguage of ſome Mens Hearts, ſince <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes;</hi> (there taking upon him to judge the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42196:52"/>
                     <hi>Root</hi> in their hearts, by the fruit in their lives) there being ſo greata foundation in the practices of ſome men to judge ſo of their hearts: Namely, That they think the King no Martyr, nor his Judges no Murtherers. Nay what if ſome do think, That they were the true Martyrs, who ſuffer'd for putting the King to death. This will be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for any man to believe, if he ſhall but conſider that not one of all thoſe men that were condemned and executed for giving Sentence againſt the late King of Bleſſed Memory, would ever acknowledge that he had ſinned againſt God in ſo doing. Since they did ſeem to be of that mind, who had the <hi>Microſcope of Death</hi> before them (which I ſo call, becauſe death oft makes men ſpy ſmall faults in themſelves, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not eſpy great ones.) Doubtleſs there are many others of the ſame mind, though a man would wonder that there ſhould be <hi>ſuch a vail of ignorance upon the hearts of any that are called Chriſtians,</hi> as not to know ſo black and foul a Crime as that to be a ſin. But ſith ſo it is, that ſome if they durſt, would rather applaud that Bloody Fact than profeſs to abhor it; and would not doubt to ſay, That Miniſters in obſerving the <hi>Thirtieth day of January</hi> as a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42196:52"/>ſolemn Faſt, do but mock God and flatter the State; being a time which ſome had rather keep as a <hi>day of Thanksgiving</hi> (the more their Sin and Shame) I think it but neceſſary, not in order to kindling of Coals or increaſing Animoſities, or cauſing the ſurviving relations of the Kings Judges to be more hated and ſcorned; for God knows I abhor any ſuch thing: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what <hi>Amaziah</hi> did, <hi>Who put to death thoſe that ſlew his Father, but he ſlew not their Children; but did as it is written in the Book of</hi> Moſes: viz. Deuter. 24.16. <hi>where the Lord commanded, ſaying, the father ſhall not die for the children, neither ſhall the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren die for their fathers; but every man ſhall die for his own ſin;</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.4. I ſay not in order to fixing any <hi>odium</hi> or diſgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurvivors, but purely to convince as many as ſtand in need of it; that Miniſters and People may and ought to obſerve the <hi>Thirtieth of January</hi> as an Anniverſary Faſt. Yea, and that our Rulers do well in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing it ſo to be kept, in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing and ſeeking the expiation of a moſt notorious Sin; and fetching out the ſtain of Royal Blood. I ſay in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I hold it neceſſary and a Duty, to ſet a Mirror before the Eyes of Men, in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42196:53"/>which they may ſee the true viſage and complexion of that horrid Crime, which God grant may never more be laid to <hi>Englands</hi> charge.

                  <p>And now you ſee, I have not charged the Kings Judges with <hi>Cumulative Treaſon</hi> (or many <hi>Petty Treaſons,</hi> or <hi>Non Treaſons,</hi> pretended when they were all put together, to amount to <hi>High Treaſon</hi>) for <hi>High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42196:53"/>it ſelf is but one Article in this Charge.</p>
                  <p>Now it remains that ſo great a Charge as this, ſhould be proved againſt them. And had I not been conſcious of its being eaſie to be proved, I would never have exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, for fear of violating the Ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Article of this Charge is <hi>Perjury,</hi> for I do aver that they who ſentenced the King to death, did in ſo doing horribly violate the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> (though an Oath of their own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) wherein they ſwore <hi>to preſerve the Kings life and honour, &amp;c.</hi> And as many of them as were his <hi>Majeſties Servants</hi> (as ſome ſuch there were) did alſo break the particular Oath which they had taken as ſuch; and thus breaking four Oaths at once, may be ſaid to be <hi>ſhod round with Perjury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some it may be would have added, that they had alſo violated their <hi>Baptiſmal Vow and Oath,</hi> and as many Repetitions and Confirmations of it, as they had made in receiving the holy <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> becauſe by thoſe two Sacramental Vows, all other Duties are bound upon men, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the obſervation of all our lawful
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42196:54"/>
                     <hi>Promiſſory Oaths;</hi> but I need not ſtrain ſo far to find out Aggravations of ſo Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Fact.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>My Charge againſt theſe men i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that of High Treaſon.</hi> It is <hi>Petty Treaſon</hi> for a Woman to kill her own Husband, though but a private man, and what petty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns are private men compared with Princes? 'Tis Treaſon by our Laws bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to imagine the death of the King, Queen, or Prince, yea to kill the Chancellor, Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or any Juſtice of either Bench; Juſtices of Aſſize, or any other Justices doing their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; is by the Statute declared to be High Treaſon.</hi> Statut. <hi>de Proditionibus,</hi> 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Yea it is <hi>Petty Treaſon for a ſervant to kill his Master,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nay clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, craſhing, rounding, or fileing for lucre ſake any of the Peoples Moneys or Coyns of this Realm, is adjudged High Treaſon;</hi> Stat. 5 Eliz. 11.</p>
                  <p>Is the Kings Money as it were inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not to be clipped or diminiſhed, but upon pain of death: and is not his perſon ſo? In a <hi>Statute</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. it is thus ſaid, <hi>It ſhall be Treaſon in any perſons whatſoever to compaſs, imagine, invent, deviſe, or intend death or any bodily harm, maim, or wounding, impriſonment, or restraint of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42196:54"/>perſon of the King,</hi> &amp;c. If to <hi>maim</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon</hi> his perſon be Treaſon, what is it then to <hi>put him to death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But methinks I hear ſome ſay, Though the Laws of <hi>England</hi> do puniſh <hi>Treaſon</hi> as a great and capital Crime, yet poſſibly it is not ſo in the eye of Gods Law? Now though every Breach of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be a ſin, yet poſſibly there are ſome Laws of Men that may be broken without ſin. To that I reply the ſinful Laws of Men are better broke than kept. Such as was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s, when he <hi>commanded all people to fall down and worſhip the Golden Image that he had ſet up;</hi> Dan. 3.5. Such alſo was <hi>Darius</hi> his, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7. <hi>when he made a Decree, That whoſoever ſhould ask a Petition of any God or man, ſave of the King, for thirty dayes; ſhould be cast into a Den of Lyons.</hi> Such alſo were the <hi>Statutes of Omry, Micah</hi> 6.16. But no man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that thoſe Laws are ſinful, by which the lives and liberties of Princes as well as of the People, are ſecured to them. Now moſt certain it is that Humane Laws, when lawful, can never be violated without ſin, or without doing that which is in the ſight of God as well as of men unlawful.</p>

                  <p>If our proverb be true, about loſing a good name, He that wholly takes away the good name, though but of a private perſon, though he do nothing more, does worſe than <hi>behead</hi> him. What then have they done, or wherewithal ſhall their Crime be expiated, who did not only take away the Head of an excellent Prince, one of a thouſand, but his good name alſo (as much as in them lay) and did not only extinguiſh his Life and Light, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make him go out in a ſnuff, and leave a loathſome ſtench behind him; which maugre all their malice God hath converted into a <hi>ſweet odor;</hi> and now he who had no Funeral Sermon on the day he was Buried, hath hundreds, that may be ſo called, preached anniverſally on the day of his Death, <hi>viz.</hi> each 30 <hi>day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> and his name imbalmed a-freſh on every ſuch day, and like to be ſo to all poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>If their Treaſon, who imbrued their hands in the Blood of the late King, were not attended with the breach of the Tenth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no ſin ever was.</hi> This horrid <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> was certainly one branch ſpringing from that bitter root <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>the root of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42196:56"/>and if of all evils, ſurely of this for one. They thought the Life of a King in an ill ſenſe <hi>more worth than the lives of ten thouſand of his Subjects;</hi> I mean a better prey, a greater booty, of which they could make more earnings and greater advantage to themſelves than of ten thouſand other Lives. They would have ſaid of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man, <hi>Quid laudis in nece tantillae beſtiae?</hi> He had not been worth the beheading, what ſhould they get by his death? But doubtleſs they had well computed what was to be gotten by the death of their King.

The Flowers and Jewels of one Royal Crown are ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich (though with a vengeance) many private Families. That by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſome of them aimed at, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo did the reſt or moſt of them that did never confeſs it. <hi>Was it not the wedge of Gold,</hi> I mean the Kings Revenues, and that which they called <hi>A Babyloniſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

So <hi>Judas</hi> for the <hi>lucre of</hi> 30 <hi>pieces betrayed his Lord and Maſter.</hi> Now if that be not a great ſin which breaks five Commandments at once, let the World judge.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I paſs on to my Third <hi>Aggravation,</hi> of their ſin who Murthered King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, <hi>It was flat and down-right Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, open and palpable Rebellion.</hi> In what can a Son more <hi>rebel</hi> againſt his Father, than if he ſeek to take away his Life, yea do actually <hi>murther</hi> him? Now Kings are as well Political Fathers to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>de facto,</hi> as they are Nurſing Fathers <hi>de jure.</hi> Yea ſuch <hi>Political Fathers</hi> are much more ſuperior to their <hi>Political,</hi> than <hi>Natural Fathers</hi> are to their <hi>Natural Children.</hi> Sons if abroad in the World and at full age, are not indecently ſuffered to be covered in the preſence of their Fathers; but may ordinary <hi>Subjects</hi> be ſo in the preſence of their King? If then Kings be unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fathers to their Subjects, and of an order of Fatherhood ſuperior to thoſe who begat them, then whatſoever is <hi>Rebellion</hi> in Children againſt their <hi>Natural Fathers,</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42196:57"/>the ſame thing if againſt their King is as true and as great, yea greater Rebellion, <hi>Ex parte objecti:</hi> Now the Scriptare calls it Rebellion in a Son, but to <hi>reſiſt</hi> and <hi>refuſe</hi> the lawful Commands of his Father, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18. <hi>If a Man have a ſtubborn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Son, which will not obey the voice of his Father, or the voice of his Mother, and that when they have chaſtened him, will not hearken to them:</hi> There you have a Rebel againſt his Natural Parents <hi>de facto, viz.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42196:58"/>to bring him before the Magiſtrates and give evidence againſt him, declaring his Crime, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaying, <hi>This our Son is ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and rebellious, a glutton and a drunkard:</hi> Then his own <hi>Countreymen</hi> or Townſmen, here called <hi>the Elders of his City,</hi> were to be his Judges, and to give ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and that ſentence of Death, and that the Death of a <hi>Dog, viz.</hi> to be <hi>ſtoned,</hi> and that ſtoning by the hand not of one ſtrange Executioner, but by the hands of <hi>Countreymen</hi> or <hi>fellow-townſmen,</hi> every one of which did or might fling a ſtone at him; ſo at once giving him, both his death and burial, and <hi>killing</hi> him, as it were, <hi>by burying him;</hi> that is, by <hi>burying</hi> him alive under a heap of Stones. This Puniſhment did the Law of God award for rebelling but againſt the Commands of a private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother; even death and ſuch a death. If he that rebelled but againſt the majeſty of a private Father or Mother were ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſurely we may allude to what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpoke to <hi>Doeg,</hi> Pſal. 120. <hi>What ſhall be given unto thee? or what ſhall be done unto thee thou falſe Tongue?? who rebelleſt</hi> againſt the Majeſty of a King; <hi>ſharp arrows of the Almighty with Coals of Juniper,</hi> as it is <hi>v.</hi> 4. Nay beyond all this, if to rebel againſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42196:58"/>the Will and Command of a <hi>private Parent</hi> were made a capital Crime, how much more than capital (if a man had any thing dearer to him than life to loſe) might it juſtly be made to rebel againſt the very Life of a King, and our own King? Hear the Prophet aggravating the ſin of Rebellion 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>ſaid, Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft, and Stubbornneſs is as Iniquity and Idolatry. Now whereas ſome may object that that is ſpoken of</hi> Saul<hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God, not of any Subjects Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him</hi> (which is very true) yet for as much as they who rebel againſt the lawful Commands of their lawful Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, in ſo doing do rebel againſt God, whoſe Vicegerents they are, whoſe Image they bear, <hi>by whom Kings Reign;</hi> and who are called <hi>The ordinance of God,</hi> Rom: 13.2. Hence may they be ſaid to be guilty of <hi>Idolatry or Witchcraft,</hi> or what is as bad, who rebel againſt their lawful Commands; but a thouſand times more who rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lives of <hi>Gods anointed ones;</hi> I mean of thoſe Kings whom God hath ſet over them.</p>
                  <p>Then let no Man ſay <hi>Rebellion</hi> is no ſin, unleſs he think that <hi>Idolatry and Witchcraft</hi> be no ſins neither. Why do we read of

                  <p>Thus having proved <hi>Perjury, High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> againſt thoſe who had their hands in murthering of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, I come in the fourth place to lay <hi>Sacriledge</hi> to their charge; of which I ſhall eaſily prove them as guilty as of the three former. Now that word <hi>Sacriledge</hi> is no ſooner dropt from my Pen, but I ſancy that at the firſt ſight thereof ſome there are that will forthwith charge <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi> upon me, for uſing it; looking upon that which we call <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> or upon the notion of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> as a meer <hi>Chimaera</hi> or <hi>Ens rationis;</hi> a Bugbear to ſcare Children. For their opinion is that there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42196:60"/>are but fours ſort of Holy things in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>The Holy God, Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Holy Angels and Archangels.</hi> 3. <hi>Holy Men and Women, or Saints Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in Heaven, and Militant upon Earth.</hi> 4. <hi>Holy Ordinances of God, ſuch as Prayer, Preaching, Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is very true, if we ſpeak concerning the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of <hi>Things,</hi> nothing but the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God,</hi> if ye take that word in the largeſt ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for Things ordained and inſtituted of God, as holy ſeparate and devoted to himſelf are holy; (for God is the Fountain of all kind of holineſs as Kings are of all temporal honours.) But the great miſtake of theſe who make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> yea who deſpiſe the word <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> lies here; by God <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> they underſtand nothing but <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Praying, Preaching, Hearing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Singing of Pſalms, Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe indeed are <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God, but whatſoever elſe is of Gods ordinaing and appointing, as ſet a part or devoted to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is Gods <hi>Ordinances</hi> Alſo: Civil <hi>Power and Authority,</hi> is called <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> Rom. 13.2. becauſe <hi>ordained of God, v.</hi> 1. and therefore ſurely it is in a ſenſe <hi>ſacred,</hi> becauſe one of Gods Ordinances.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42196:60"/>Upon that account it was that the <hi>Ark</hi> of God, though but a piece of Wood, was called <hi>Holy,</hi> and that we do read ſo often of <hi>Holy days,</hi> the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and other feſtivals; yea of <hi>holy places,</hi> yea <hi>of the holy of holies, or moſt holy place</hi> (which was the inmoſt Temple (called the <hi>Sanctuary</hi>) and that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem is called the Holy City.</hi> Alſo of <hi>the Holy Veſſels that were in the Tabernacle,</hi> 1 Kings 8.4. <hi>And of the Holy Garments made for</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons,</hi> Exod. 28.3. and 29.29.

                  <p>Now in this ſenſe it may be truly nnd ſoberly ſaid of all Kings, as ſuch, that they are <hi>ſacred, viz.</hi> Becauſe the Powers that are are, ordained of God, and cannot be reſiſted but upon pain of damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Sacriledge</hi> being the <hi>violation of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things</hi> (for that all Scholars know to be the true notion of it) and the Perſons and Authority of Kings being <hi>ſacred</hi> (as

                  <p>But there is one cauſe more of mens deſpiſing the great ſin of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing of it, <hi>viz.</hi> A great miſtake which they are and have been under, as touching the <hi>holineſs</hi> of Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> That they know and acknowledge no holineſs of Perſons, but that which the Scripture intends, when it ſaith, <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> Whereas moſt evident it is, both from the Old and New Teſtament, that Perſons are very often called <hi>holy</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a much more laxe, large and looſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

                  <p>Some have charged <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi> for alienating the Veſſels of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, only ſo far forth as to drink in them, when he feaſted a thouſand of his Nobles at one time; others have called the ſin of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira Sacriledge,</hi> and ſo it was to keep back any part of that which they had dedicated to God and to his Church; but ſith the two firſt inſtances of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> are much more notorious than theſe two latter, if I ſhall prove that Murthering of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was greater <hi>Sacriledge</hi> than either of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Than that of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, and that of <hi>Achan,</hi> by proving the greater, I have certainly prov'd the leſs: for <hi>Omne majus in ſe continet minus.</hi> As for the <hi>Sacriledge</hi> of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons it was but this, They took a part of Gods Meat (for ſo were Sacrifices as the Altar was Gods Table) and whereas it ſhould have been boil'd for Gods uſe, they cauſed it to be roſted for their own. They rob'd him of part of his Meat, who if <hi>he were hungry would not tell us, for his are the Beaſts upon a thouſand Mountains,</hi> Pſal. 50.12. <hi>The
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42196:67"/>World is his and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> &amp;c. They were <hi>over-kind</hi> to themſelves and over-bold with God, which coſt them dear, as you have read; but what is all that in compariſon of being cruel to the Life of a Man, a Chriſtian, a Prince, and our own Prince? The <hi>Sacriledge</hi> of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons compared with that of Murthering the King, ſeems (if I may ſo ſpeak) to have been <hi>lighter than vanity and nothing:</hi> Nay doubtleſs it did far exceed that <hi>Sacriledge</hi> of <hi>Achan,</hi> which was greater than that of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons: For what was it that that <hi>Achan</hi> (who for his ſin was <hi>ſtoned</hi> to death and <hi>burn'd,</hi> and called <hi>the troubler of Iſrael,</hi> becauſe of the ſad conſequence of it) did ſteal from God? Was it not only a <hi>Garment, ſome Silver,</hi> and <hi>one wedge of Gold?</hi> Now what trifles, what meer bawbles are all thoſe things, if weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ballance againſt the Life of the King?</p>
                  <p>I thought to have wholly paſſed by the inſtance of of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah,</hi> their <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> which together with the lie that attended it, was puniſhed with preſent death. How much leſs was their <hi>Sacriledge</hi> than theirs who put the late King to death? They rob'd the Church but of a <hi>ſacred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> if I may ſo call it, becauſe devoted to God; but theſe of a <hi>ſacred Life:</hi> nay
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42196:67"/>they ſtole away but part of an eſtate, theſe deſtroyed a precious Life not in part but in whole. They with-held but what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had given and might have choſen whither they would have given, and could give again; but the Murtherers of our King withdrew that which they never did or could give, and which when they had once withdrawn, they nor all the World could never give again. They deſtroyed but one ſmall ſinew of the Church (if money may be ſo called, as it is called the ſinew of War) yea did but ſtrike that one little ſinew, but theſe cut off the temporal Head of the Church (for ſo we own the King of <hi>England</hi> to be next and immediately under God Supream Head and Governor.) How great then was that <hi>Sacriledge</hi> which hath clearly outdone that of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah,</hi> that of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, that of <hi>Achan;</hi> yea the moſt notorious of all the <hi>Sacriledges</hi> recorded in Scripture, if not all thoſe <hi>Sacriledges</hi> put together. Who now cryes not out as the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the ſlain,</hi> &amp;c. ſlain with the Aggravations of multiplied <hi>perjury, high Treaſon, horrid Rebellion, tranſcendent

For Firſt, If he had done any thing worthy of death, who but <hi>the King of Kings</hi> had authority to puniſh him for it, or to inflict upon him the death which he had deſerved?

                  <p>And ſo I proceed to the <hi>eighth Article,</hi> wherewith I charge the ſaid <hi>King's Judges,</hi> viz. <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> I ſay with great <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> practized in that fact. It was <hi>Homici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium maxime Hypocriticum.</hi> It was even the Maſter-piece of <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Cheat</hi> under the Notion of Piety that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was impoſed upon the world. Now all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42196:74"/>
                     <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> is a perfect Lye, and <hi>the fault that needs a Lye grows two thereby</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> tells us.) Who that underſtands the intrigue of that Buſineſs, do's not cry out, <hi>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum?</hi> Could ſuch a Monſter ſpring from the Womb of Religion? Who laid that Brat at her Door? For it was none of hers. So Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians talk moſt of Religion, when they mean nothing leſs; <hi>as if they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate by taking God and Religion often into their mouths, for their having nothing of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their hearts.</hi> Commend me to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Story which I heard from a Reverend and dignified Divine, not far off, and not long ſince, which was to this purpoſe: <hi>An excellent Knight told me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a year or two before the late War betwixt the King and Parliament broke out, there were ſeveral Meetings held at his houſe</hi> (<hi>then in</hi> Covent-Garden) <hi>betwixt ſome great Officers of State that were then in play, and other popular Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who had a great mind to their places. The late King was privy to all their Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (if not ſometimes preſent) and finding where the</hi> Cardo Controverſiae, <hi>or Hinge of the Controverſie was,</hi> viz. <hi>that ſome Popular, but yet private, and unpreferr'd Gentlemen thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to get into publick Offices, ſuch</hi> (<hi>as Mr. of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42196:75"/>the Court of Wards,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>and that they would never be quiet till it were effected, yielded that all of them, ſave one, to whom he had ſome particular and unpardonable exception, ſhould have and enjoy the Places and Offices which they ſought for; but the King refuſing him, and they being reſolved upon one and all, hit or miſs, the meeting was quite diſſolved; and not long after the War broke out; which, ſaith he, could every one of thoſe great Seekers have found the Preferment which he ſought for, had been prevented.</hi> But that which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Story ſaid moſt of all to my purpoſe was this: <hi>Whilſt we were thus ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying at this our meeting from time to time, one half to hold the places which we were poſſeſt of</hi> (<hi>or</hi> parta tueri) <hi>the other half of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to throw us out and get themſelves into our places; without thoſe Walls nothing was talkt of but Religion, what great contrivances there were at that time for reforming and ſettling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whilſt, God knows, within thoſe Walls there was not all that while one word ſpoken concerning Religion, but ſome of us were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hold our Preferments, and others to get them away from us.</hi> O Nation ſweetly cheated! O thou bleſſed Name <hi>Religion!</hi> how oft haſt thou been miſus'd and made uſe of to <hi>chriſten</hi> the moſt horrid Villanies:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42196:75"/>For the Proverb has prov'd too true, <hi>In no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Domine incipit omne malum:</hi> Was it not under pretext of <hi>Religion,</hi> becauſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as was alledged could not be preferr'd; if he were ſuffer'd to live, <hi>that that Martyrs blood muſt be made ſhed for the Church?</hi> that the <hi>King</hi>'s Head was ſaid to be cut off? As if to cut off the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> were the only way to keep life in the <hi>Body</hi> thereof: Now how fond and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a thing was it, how groundleſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious a ſlander and cenſure, to ſay or think that the life of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> could not conſiſt with the true Chriſtian and Proteſtant Religion?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, they knew no more than their heels, when the <hi>Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Law was gone, what to put in the room of it; for they themſelves were not of one <hi>Religion:</hi> nay, what if many of them were of no <hi>Religion.</hi> What think you of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and St. <hi>Scot,</hi> were they not pure Saints? with ſeveral others of thoſe <hi>Aeacus's</hi> and <hi>Radamanthus's,</hi> who gave Sentence againſt the late <hi>King?</hi> Oh, how did they burn? Was it with zeal for <hi>Religion?</hi> A man would hardly think that <hi>Religion</hi> to be <hi>chaſte</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> which ſuch men courted or ſeemed to court. What
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42196:76"/>Religion, I beſeech you, in pulling down all the fences of the Church, and letting in all ſorts <hi>of little foxes and wild bores to ſpoil God's Vineyard.</hi> If this were Reformation, it was not unlike that in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the whole Land did ſwarm and was over-run with <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Lice,</hi> and <hi>Flies, Exod.</hi> 8. Whilſt theſe men pretended to the <hi>honour</hi> of Religion, who ever <hi>diſgraced</hi> it more? to the <hi>preſervation</hi> of true <hi>Religion,</hi> who <hi>indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered</hi> it more? to the <hi>Reforming</hi> of Religion who ever <hi>deform'd</hi> and undid it more? Look how the Ivy whilſt it creeps into the wall, and claſp's cloſe about it; embracing it as it were with greateſt kindneſs, doth mean time rot, decay, and periſh it: or look how the <hi>Ape</hi> ſo hugs her young ones, as that ſhe kills them with her kindneſs; ſo kind and no kinder were thoſe <hi>bloody Reformers</hi> to true <hi>Religion,</hi> which they could have as ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to have lookt in the face, as a <hi>Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> his ſevereſt <hi>Creditor,</hi> or a <hi>Malefactor</hi> his <hi>Judge.</hi> Surely they were never intended by God for <hi>Reformers,</hi> conſidering what God ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not build an Houſe for my Name, becauſe thou haſt been a man of war,</hi> or <hi>haſt ſhed blood.</hi> Who could expect a Reformation of ſuch men's making, worthy the coſt of that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42196:76"/>Royal Blood wherewith they purchaſed it: That which they gave us was to dear by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very drop which the purchaſe coſt them. When I am convinc'd that <hi>Jezebel</hi> took the courſe which ſhe took with <hi>Naboth</hi> upon a Religious account, that a zeal to reform Religion put her upon <hi>writing Letters in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab's name, and ſealing them with his Seal,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.8, 9, 10. <hi>ſaying, Proclaim a Faſt, and ſet Nabal on high among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſet ſons of Belial to bear witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſaying, Thou didſt blaspheme God and the King; and then carry him out and ſtone him, that he may die.</hi> I ſay, when I believe that a true zeal againſt blaſpheming of God, made her do as ſhe did; who 'tis moſt certain, did all this meerly in order to what we <hi>read</hi> ver. 15. <hi>When Jezebel heard that Naboth was ſtoned and was dead; Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belſaid to Ahab, Ariſe, take poſſeſſion of the Vineyard of Naboth, which he refuſed to give thee for money; for Naboth is dead.</hi> I ſay, when I ſo believe, then, and not till then, ſhall I think that an unfeign'd deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote true and undefiled <hi>Religion,</hi> to keep out <hi>Popery,</hi> and to reform <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> as practiſed amongſt us, was that which prompted the unhappy Judges of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, to ſend him packing

                  <p>Ninthly, To all the former, I muſt needs add, That the putting of <hi>King Charles the Martyr</hi> to death, was <hi>Parricidium, Parricide,</hi> or the <hi>Murthering of a Father,</hi> a Crime which uſeth to make <hi>the ears of all that hear ſuch a thing done, to tingle.</hi> If a <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daughter</hi> happen to kill either of their Parents, all the Country rings of it; and it makes as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42196:78"/>it were an Earthquake throughout the whole Kingdom. But the <hi>Parricide of Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides</hi> was then committed, when K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was put to death, who was not only a Father to them that had a hand in it, but to the whole Nation: beſides, a <hi>common</hi> Father, a <hi>Political,</hi> though not a <hi>natural</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To be fure he was one of thoſe whom the fifth Commandment intends, by the name of Father, when it ſaith, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother;</hi> meaning every whit as much <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> whom God hath ſomewhere promiſed to make <hi>nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers</hi> to his Church; as thoſe whom the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls the <hi>Fathers of our Fleſh.</hi> For though we owe not our <hi>Being</hi> to them, as to our natural <hi>Fathers,</hi> yet our <hi>well-being</hi> we do owe to them under God; though we owe not our <hi>Generation</hi> to them, yet our <hi>Preſervation</hi> we do owe to them under God. Every good King is a <hi>Protector</hi> of his People, as to their <hi>Lives, Limbs, Eſtates, good Names, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Property, Religion,</hi> &amp;c. And is not that a great piece of Fatherhood (as I may call it?) Are not his Subjects <hi>ſafe under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings?</hi> Philoſophers ſay, That <hi>Preſervation is a continued Creation.</hi> If that be ſo, do we not owe as much to thoſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42196:78"/>by whom we are preſerved under God (though not ſo preſerved as by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) as to them by whom we were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated. <hi>David</hi> did both repreſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and was repreſented by others unto <hi>Nabal</hi> as one that had deſerv'd very well at his hands, and the hands of his; becauſe he was able to ſay, as it is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.7. <hi>Thy ſhepherds were iwth us, we hurt them not, neither was ought miſſing to them all the while they were in Carmel:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, It is a favour in thoſe who have power over us (though no lawful Princes neither) if they do us no hurt.

                  <p>A ſhort proof may ſerve for each of the particulars aforeſaid, they being ſo much known to all ingenious men, that have either ſeen or read of the affairs and tranſactions of the late times: the truth is, the names of <hi>ſymptomes,</hi> which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, becauſe by <hi>Metaphor</hi> applied to <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> or <hi>morals,</hi> may need ſome little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, but when that is done they will eaſily command aſſent and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42196:82"/>Briefly then were there not <hi>Magna Jactationes,</hi> that is, great <hi>toſſings and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings up and down</hi> in thoſe days (as dying men turn from ſide to ſide, ſit up, lie down again, call to riſe and to be removed from bed to bed, and chamber to chamber, finding themſelves uneaſie in every poſture, ſeeking reſt in change of poſture though they find none.) How oft did we ſhift and change Governments in one year? pull down one and ſet up another, and pull down that again; <hi>Sic cum voluit fortuna jocari.</hi> So were we <hi>banded</hi> as it were by <hi>fortune,</hi> or <hi>male-adminiſtration rather,</hi> from end to end; ſo <hi>reell'd</hi> we too and fro like drunken men, or like a ſhip ready to be overſet with ſtiff and contrary winds; ſo ſound <hi>we no reſt for the ſole of our feet;</hi> and it was moſt eaſie to make the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick, that nothing but a miracle of divine power and goodneſs, could ſave us from ſudden death and ruine. Such Governments as they then ſet up, ſeemed to be things that would not <hi>keep</hi> above a month or two, or little <hi>Gourds</hi> which had a <hi>Worm</hi> at their root, which cauſed them to wither preſently. And as the Nation had at that time little <hi>reſt</hi> in one ſenſe, ſo little <hi>ſleep</hi> in another; for were not the minds
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42196:82"/>of men continually kept awake with <hi>fears</hi> and ſad <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> like people that live in an old rotten decay'd houſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſleep in tempeſtous nights for fear the houſe they dwell in ſhould fall upon their heads? Theſe were the <hi>magnae vigiliae</hi> which I ſpoke of, or rather the cauſes why men could not <hi>ſleep</hi> in thoſe days as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to do, and ought to have done.</p>
                  <p>Again, whoſoever knows what <hi>State-Convulſions</hi> mean, muſt needs underſtand that we had a great many of them in thoſe days. There are <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> Convulſions ſpoken of by Phyſicians, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome of particular parts only, as of the eyes, when they are diſtorted; of the mouth, when that is drawn awry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again of the whole body, whereby a man is rackt, as it were, from head to foot; we had of both ſorts in thoſe unſettled times, Diſturbances in particular Counties, otherwhile almoſt all the Nation over. We were pull'd and hall'd forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as one ſort of Convulſion is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; yea, ſometimes the Nation ſeem'd to be <hi>ſtiff</hi> as a <hi>ſtake,</hi> to have no motion with it, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Convulſion, called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, when it is ſo with a Body: Was it not often ſo
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42196:83"/>that we knew not how or which way to turn our ſelves?</p>
                  <p>Again, Could any Natural or Animal body have a worſe <hi>Pulſe</hi> than <hi>England</hi> had in thoſe days? One while the Pulſe of the Nation beat as high and feaveriſhly as could be, that is all things were done furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, the Army called up to the City (which was to be the <hi>Trojan Horſe</hi> for that time) the very Gates of the City appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be broken down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Otherwhile the <hi>Pulſe</hi> of the Nation did beat exceeding low, ſo it could ſcarce be felt, was <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unequal, intermitted often;</hi> it was often <hi>ſlow</hi> or <hi>languid,</hi> like that which goeth by the name of <hi>Pulſus mynrus, vermiculans,</hi> which is very bad; yea, <hi>Formicans,</hi> which is worſt of all: The firſt of which <hi>viz. Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> betokens a Pulſe that dwindles leſs and leſs like a Mous's tail: The ſecond, <hi>viz. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculans,</hi> a Pulſe that creeps or crawles like a Worm: And the laſt, <hi>viz. Formicans; i. e.</hi> a Pulſe that takes many ſteps like an Ant, but the pooreſt ſtrides that can be thought of, as if it moved but a hairs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth at a time. It were eaſie, but that I would not be too tedious, to find out things in the late times that did bear proportion to each of theſe.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42196:83"/>
                  <p>As for <hi>Deliquiums, Lypothimies,</hi> or <hi>faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-fits,</hi> nothing was more ordinary than them in thoſe days: For, as <hi>the whole head was ſick, ſo the whole heart was faint, mens hearts failed them very much, for fear of thoſe things which were coming upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Nation was then in frequent <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liriums</hi> or <hi>Frenzies</hi> is the eaſieſt thing of all to prove; for how <hi>madly</hi> would men talk in thoſe days, and how wildly did they act? Who hath not heard diſcourſes of <hi>drying up the River Euphrates,</hi> interpreted to be ſeizing upon the Gold and Silver Mines of Popiſh Princes, which was to have been effected by taking <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in lieu of which we accepted of <hi>Jamaico;</hi> alſo of ſending an Army to <hi>Rome</hi> to pull down the Pope. Of our Saviours coming in the year 1666, now paſt and gone, to reign upon the earth; (and you know who intended or pretended themſelves to be his Fore-runners.) And did not men act as wiſely in thoſe days as they talkt? How did they do and undo, ſet up and pull down again, and could come to no conſiſtency?</p>
                  <p>That <hi>England</hi> in thoſe times did fetch its breath very ſhort, and was, as they ſay, very much out of breath (for ſo we had run our ſelves) was obvious to every mans eye and obſervation.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:42196:84"/>
                  <p>As for <hi>Singultus</hi> or <hi>Hiccough</hi> (a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſymptom in ſick bodies) how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that to the caſe of <hi>England</hi> in the late times may ſeem hardeſt; but the definition of that Diſeaſe doth agree thereunto, therefore the thing deſigned muſt needs do ſo likewiſe. What is a <hi>Hiccough, but a convulſive motion of the Stomach, labouring to caſt off ſomething which ſticks upon the coats thereof, and by either its quantity or quality rather, doth much offend it?</hi> Sure I am, many things did ſtick upon the Stomach of the Nation in thoſe days, which fain they would have caſt off, and did uſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſo to do, but could not effect it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the Nation had <hi>faciem Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocraticam</hi> in thoſe days (or did <hi>look like death:</hi>) I appeal to all that were judicious Spectators of it. Did we not look ſo ghaſtly as would even fright one? ſo pale, ſo thin, ſo wan, ſo ſharp like a <hi>Skeleton,</hi> or like a deaths-head; ſo like a body that the Grave waited for, and the worms ſtood ready to devour? Were were not then the <hi>pity</hi> of <hi>our friends</hi> and the <hi>ſcorn</hi> of our <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</hi> Thus low was a once flouriſhing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought by the hands and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cruel Regicides, men profound to make ſlaughter, to ruine and demoliſh, but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42196:84"/>how to cure the breaches and diſtempers of a Nation they had no skill. More I could ſay upon this head, but for brevity-ſake, I paſs on to the next.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Taking away the life of the King was <hi>Regnicidium,</hi> or the deſtruction of a Kingdom. For one and the ſame blow cut off the head of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> both at once. For what Kigdom can there be without a King? What ſignifies a body without a head? That Notion or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Rex nunquam moritur,</hi> i. e. <hi>The King never dieth,</hi> was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts become very <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> when the late good King did not actually reign either in his own Petſon, or in his proper Heir or Succeſſor, or any of his Line and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. I have been overſavorable in talking of their deſtroying one Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is they did deſtroy three <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> at once, that were united under that one good King. The miſchief of their ſo doing will more fully appear, by what I ſhall ſay under the next head.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, This their horrid murder was not only <hi>Regnicidium, &amp; Regicidium,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicidium,</hi> but <hi>Monarchiae-cidium, i. e.</hi> not meerly the deſtruction of one <hi>King</hi> and three <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> or of one <hi>Monarch</hi> and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42196:85"/>
                     <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but of all <hi>Monarchy</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> of all that moſt excellent form of Government in all parts of the world, ſo far as in them lay. For 1. They gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations a moſt pernicious Example of depoſing <hi>Kings,</hi> and caſting off <hi>Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> 2. Did they not make it their buſineſs by writing and ſpeaking to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and to bring all Nations out of conceit with it, and to make it odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the whole world? 3. Did not the <hi>Army</hi> that then was, ſwear againſt being ever after governed by a ſingle Perſon; but they only exchang'd (or ſuffer'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd) a <hi>Rowland</hi> for <hi>an Oliver</hi> (you know my meaning) and ſo therewith all was ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Now give me leave to tell you, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to deſtroy <hi>Monarchy,</hi> they labour'd to deſtroy the beſt form of Government in the world (as they that know me, do know that I have often ſaid and undertook to prove.) For <hi>Monarchy</hi> is that Government which the light of Nature leads men to, &amp; neceſſarily caſts them upon. For the truth is, all Governments in the world by what names ſoever they are called or diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are nothing elſe but <hi>diſguiſed</hi> and <hi>imperfect Monarchies.</hi> And this holds true
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42196:85"/>both in <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Governments, as of Courts, Cities, Towns, <hi>Families, Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, Corporations,</hi> as well as in <hi>States, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,</hi> publick <hi>Ariſtocracies</hi> or <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies,</hi> as they are called both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> Take the inſtance in <hi>Juries,</hi> Is there not commonly one leading man that ſways all the reſt? So in all <hi>Committees,</hi> in <hi>Courts</hi> of Judicature or other Courts. So in <hi>Republicks:</hi> ſo in <hi>Congregational Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> For admit the diffuſed power of the two laſt ſhould happen to be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided (as is poſſible for it to be, and yet to have a power of determining it ſelf and turn the Scales) muſt not that be done by ſome one man? will it not neceſſarily iſſue there? For ſay, All power were in a <hi>Senate,</hi> conſiſting of a thouſand men; admit there be all the Members of that Senate preſent at a debate, ſave only one; by means of whoſe abſence, there being five hundred <hi>Votes</hi> on the one ſide, there can be but 499 on the other; upon this ſo great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion you ſee the whole Affair is carried by <hi>but one voice.</hi> Even amongſt thoſe who by their conſtitution have an equal ſhare in Government, is there not generally a <hi>Dominus fac totum,</hi> a <hi>Chieftain,</hi> or <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant,</hi> a <hi>Leading-man,</hi> a man that hath
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42196:86"/>the caſting voice generally given him, in whoſe advice and counſel all the reſt or the major part of them, do acquieſce? And what is ſuch a man but a <hi>Monarch</hi> in his place, and amongſt thoſe over whom he governs ſo abſolutely, ſo uncontroulably, let him go by what name he will, either of <hi>Juſtice, Magiſtrate</hi> or <hi>Miniſter, &amp;c.</hi> Kings themſelves do not act without their Privy Council and other perſons of Honor, who are aſſiſting to their Affairs; but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with them, their advice and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they do what they pleaſe. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo do thoſe <hi>petty inviſible Princes</hi> or <hi>Kings,</hi> that walk <hi>incognito</hi> and under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. They in conjunction with ſome of the beſt <hi>Head-pieces</hi> that are about them, and by the aſſiſtance of their party which adheres to them, carry what they pleaſe, carry all before them, in ſpight of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Thus it was from the beginning, thus it now is, and will be to the end of the world. Were it not eaſie to ſay, Who is in effect a <hi>Monarch</hi> amongſt the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> and, amongſt the <hi>Quakers, &amp;c?</hi> So that all the Governments in the world are <hi>virtually,</hi> and in <hi>effect Monarchies,</hi> though the people ſee it not, and their Votes are little more than for <hi>faſhion-ſake,</hi> and to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42196:86"/>pleaſe them with a ſhadow of Power and Liberty, when their real power is little <hi>more than to ſit ſtill.</hi> He then that is an Enemy to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and to every thing that is like it, will preſently become an enemy to all ſorts of Governments all the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which are indeed and truth but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Virtual Monarchies,</hi> all things conſidered. So men fly the <hi>Name,</hi> whilſt they continue the <hi>Thing;</hi> and alter the <hi>Shadow,</hi> whilſt they accept the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> over them. Amongſt thoſe who are equal in power, the wiſeſt will always govern the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and they that by their <hi>Wealth</hi> or <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or otherwiſe, can make the greateſt Party will carry all before them. If then the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> and <hi>univerſal practice of the world</hi> hath determined <hi>Monarchy</hi> to be the beſt and moſt neceſſary form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who can ſufficiently decry their ſin, who did not only deſtroy an excellent <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Monarch,</hi> but alſo aimed at the deſtruction of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Kingly Power</hi> throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> that if it were poſſible the Name and Thing might be rooted out, and might be reſtor'd no more. And ſo I have made good the 12th thing which I charg'd upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> an attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Monarchy, though it be the beſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the world.</p>

                  <p>Thirteenthly, It muſt needs be confeſt they were <hi>Self-murtherers,</hi> or <hi>Felo de ſe's,</hi> who murthered the late King. For in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his life, they forfeited their own. If an <hi>Earl</hi> or a greater <hi>Subject,</hi> do wilfully but murther a poor Foot-man, or Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, by ſo doing he forfeits his life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Law, yea, and the Law of <hi>England</hi> too. He then that kills a <hi>King,</hi> had he a hundred thouſand lives, would by ſo doing forfeit every one of them, and be made to pay his forfeiture too, unleſs great clemency interpoſe. I remember no one <hi>Regicide</hi> in all the Scripture but what is puniſhed with death, ſave only that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> committed upon the perſon of <hi>Joram,</hi> which being done at the expreſs command of God, ought not, I think, to be called <hi>Regicide.</hi> But I paſs on.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, The murthering of the late <hi>King</hi> was <hi>Animaecidium,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Self-murther,</hi> as to each of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> but <hi>Soul-murther,</hi> as to every of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the infinite Mercy of God ſhould ſtep in and prevent it. Is Hell-fire the wages of them that wilfully murder but a private perſon; witneſs thoſe words, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. And <hi>ye know no murderer hath eternal life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in him:</hi> i. e. no wilful murtherer
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42196:87"/>hath <hi>jus in re, as to eternal life,</hi> i. e. any preſent actual capacity, to enter into life eternal; as he that was under a Leproſie under the Law might not for that time be admitted to eat the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> though <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> i. e. a <hi>dormant ſuſpended right,</hi> which may or ſhall be reſtor'd and redintegrated upon his repentance, that he may have as <hi>David</hi> had when he defiled <hi>Bathſheba:</hi> But divers do ſay, If <hi>David</hi> had never actually repented of that great ſin, he had never had eternal life, but had been everlaſtingly damn'd: So <hi>Baronius</hi> in his excellent Book <hi>De peccato mortali &amp; veniali.</hi> If the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful murthering of one private man be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſink a Soul into Hell, what will not the murder of a <hi>King</hi> do? Will not God heat that Furnace yet ten times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for <hi>Regicides? Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> are called <hi>ſinners againſt their own Souls,</hi> Numb. 16.38. for rebelling againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Aaron,</hi> i. e. for but <hi>murmuring</hi> againſt them, though not one drop of blood was ſhed by their hands. How greatly then have they ſinn'd againſt their own Souls, who have rebelled and <hi>reſiſted</hi> even to blood? I have before quoted that Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>They that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> I leave that word to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42196:88"/>
                     <hi>fasten</hi> this head on their Conſciences, as <hi>a nail in a ſure place,</hi> and paſs on to the next.</p>
                  <p>Fifteenthly, The murthering of the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>Multicidium</hi> (pardon the making of a new word in ſuch a caſe as this) or <hi>Caedes multorum;</hi> or <hi>Homicidium multiplicatum &amp; complicatum,</hi> i. e. it was <hi>a great many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in one.</hi> Firſt, it was <hi>virtually</hi> ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>computation</hi> which we read of, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.3. But <hi>the people anſwered, Thou ſhalt not go forth</hi> (i. e. <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſhould not go forth to Battle) <hi>thou art more worth than ten thouſand of us,</hi> &amp;c. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It was <hi>actually</hi> ſo, as the Complices in that violent action, by encouraging and emboldning each other thereunto, were guilty of the ſin and death of one another. Thirdly, As the death of the late <hi>King</hi> was remotely the death of many perſons and families, I mean the ruine and deſtruction of multitudes of Families, which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, which was worſe than <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ath</hi> its ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Sixteenthly, <hi>Putting of the late King to death, was</hi> Legicidium, <hi>as well as</hi> Regici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, <hi>i. e.</hi> the death of the <hi>Law,</hi> as well as of the <hi>King.</hi> For firſt, By <hi>the King's death a stop was put to the making of any
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42196:88"/>more Laws,</hi> which might be judged neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the good of the Nation. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King no Law can be made: His Royal Aſſent, Sanction, and <hi>Fiat,</hi> makes every Law to be a Law: Therefore the <hi>Parliament</hi> did never preſume to call any things by the name of a <hi>Law,</hi> which they made without the <hi>King;</hi> but by the name not of <hi>Acts,</hi> but of <hi>Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Secondly, there was ſtop put to the execution of thoſe good and wholſome <hi>Laws,</hi> which were before in being. <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is the life of Laws,</hi> and who but the King is the great <hi>Executioner</hi> of Laws, or the life of their <hi>Execution?</hi> When <hi>Judges</hi> and other great men in the Law went off by death, who but a King could legally ſubſtitute others in their room? If any Juſtice be done by Officers not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally called and conſtituted, we muſt be beholden to <hi>uſurpation</hi> for it <hi>Laws</hi> are things full of life and ſpirit, if they be ſuch for the <hi>conſtitution</hi> and <hi>execution</hi> of them as they ought to be; and upon the life of good Laws depend all our <hi>Lives, Liberties, good Names, Eſtates, Properties.</hi> It is as it were <hi>the breath of their Noſtrils.</hi> If the true <hi>Soul of the Law</hi> go out of it (which is the King) they muſt either be reſtored by ſome
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42196:89"/>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> or <hi>uſurping ſpirit,</hi> or fall to the ground. They who deſtroy our Laws, or the due <hi>execution</hi> of them, had as good in effect <hi>burn up</hi> all our Ships, break down all our Forts and Fences; yea, they had as good almoſt cut down all our Banks and Buttreſſes upon the Sea-ſhore, and let in the Sea upon us, as do what they do. He that deſtroys one good <hi>Law,</hi> or the effect and progreſs of it, may do the world more miſchief, than if he had deſtroy'd twenty men, yea, a hundred ſuch as they might be. I had almoſt ſaid, If a man could ſtop the motion of the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and all their Influences upon the earth, their light, and height, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ought I know, would not be more miſſed than the free courſe or progreſs of <hi>Laws</hi> would be. What <hi>Death</hi> then could be greater than their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits,</hi> who kill'd not only the <hi>Law-maker,</hi> but the <hi>Laws</hi> themſelves, which are all in all in all that we have to ſhew or plead for any thing that we call ours in this world.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly. Alas! alas! that I ſhould yet have more wherewith to accuſe thoſe poor unhappy men, who put the late King to death; I ſay it was <hi>Homicidium barbarum,</hi> a <hi>barbarous Murther</hi> in reference to the circumſtances of it. Who knows not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42196:89"/>that <hi>cruelty</hi> may be ſhew'd even towards a noxious Brute, which ought to be put to death; as towards a <hi>wild Boar,</hi> or the like, namely, by making its neceſſary death more <hi>painful,</hi> or more <hi>lingring</hi> than it need to be; but if the ſame thing be done to a harmleſs <hi>Animal,</hi> as to a <hi>tame Dove,</hi> or ſuch like, the cruelty and barbarouſneſs is yet greater upon that account. If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity be applied to a reaſonable Creature, man or woman, it is counted ten times ſo barbarous; but when barbarous uſage ſhall be applied to a <hi>Prince,</hi> a <hi>King, our own King.</hi> a <hi>virtuous King, and one that had been a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs</hi> for many years together not to grant him as handſome an <hi>Exit</hi> out of the world, as could conſiſt with an untimely death, was ſuch a tranſcendant inſtance of <hi>inhumane barbarity,</hi> as I think no age can paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel.</p>

Who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inſtance in men, who but a little while before were generally vogud to be but <hi>carnal</hi> or <hi>moral men,</hi> that to ſerve an end, have preſently been <hi>run up to Saints, cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized</hi> all of the ſudden; and they who but a few weeks before were thought not to have grace ſo much as a <hi>grain of muſter-ſeed,</hi> amounts to their grace in an inſtance, was become (by common ſame) <hi>like as a great tree, ſo that the birds of the air might come and lodge on the branches thereof.</hi> But let me tell thee (Reader) even ſuch Princes as were <hi>Antiochus, Epiphanes</hi> (or <hi>Epimanes,</hi> as ſome call him) and ſuch as <hi>Nero,</hi> who
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42196:94"/>reſpective to their <hi>morals,</hi> have appeared in the world like <hi>Devils,</hi> yet were <hi>Gods by Office and Denomination</hi> from Scripture (and we muſt alwayes allow that <hi>God who is the fountain of all honour,</hi> is the beſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi> and beſt knows what title to give to every one) and in their place and ſphere ought to be reſpected as ſuch. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when inadvertently he called <hi>Ananias the high Prieſt</hi> a <hi>whited-wall,</hi> Acts 23.3. <hi>for judging contrary to the Law,</hi> when it was ſaid to him, <hi>Revileſt thou Gods high Prieſt;</hi> repli'd, <hi>I wiſt not that he was the high Prieſt, for it is written, Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ruler of thy people:</hi> Not but that he of whom he ſpake it, was in and of himſelf as a <hi>whited wall</hi> or <hi>painted ſepulcher;</hi> but nevertheleſs the reſpect due to a a great <hi>Noble</hi> ought to have been paid him in his place. Yea, to kill a very bad Prince were <hi>Deicide,</hi> or the killing of a <hi>mortal god,</hi> for as a <hi>Prince</hi> he is a god. But what if a King that reſembles God, not only in his <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> but <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> not only in his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> but in his <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> in his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> and ſeveral other of his moſt glorious Attributes (and ſuch a one many have told us, that knew him, if we did not, was King <hi>Charles</hi> the

                  <p>Now if any man ſhall ask me that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divious queſtion (as ſome account it) which of the Kings Subjects was it that put him to death? I anſwer firſt of all <hi>Negatively, Not the Body or Community of the Nation, not the major part or generallity,</hi> but a few in compariſon of them. 2. <hi>Not the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Nation, the Parliament I mean;</hi> for all the <hi>Lords</hi> diſclaim'd it, and and moſt of the <hi>Commons,</hi> and were laid aſide to make way for it; but <hi>poſitively</hi> firſt, All that were active in the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King and Parliament, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to have <hi>remotely</hi> and <hi>ignorantly,</hi> though not <hi>voluntarily</hi> and <hi>intentionally</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed thereunto, becauſe that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him had never been but for the War. Some <hi>claſſical</hi> men ſore againſt their will and intention, were partly acceſſary to that moſt <hi>unclaſſical</hi> and <hi>illegal</hi> action.</p>
                  <p>But they muſt needs be charg'd with the <hi>murthering of the King,</hi> who ſuffered themſelves to be made his <hi>Judges</hi> and to ſit as ſuch. His very <hi>Executioner,</hi> whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that diſguiſed Caitiff was (for whom

If</hi> there be no ſort of men to whom the Characters aforeſaid do agree; ſith no Party is nam'd, none need to be concern'd; but if any ſuch there be, or have been, they were they who ſaid of the King's death. Ah! ah! ſo would we have it. The Limner who drew the foregoing Picture thought it a diſparagement to write under it. <hi>This is the Picture of ſuch an one:</hi> for if it be like no body, it is good for nothing. 'Tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſome whom it doth not concern, will out of a jealous humour, apply it to themſelves; but let them be warn'd by what was ſaid of one that did ſo. <hi>I</hi> (ſaid the Author of a certain Character) <hi>have made a Fools Cap, and ſuch an one has put it upon his head, and fancies that it fits him.</hi> But in good earneſt, if the Painter have not wrong'd thoſe people whoſe Picture he meant to give us, but ſuch be their real Feature and Portraicture, if it be as like them as can be they are a people worthy to be expoſed, chid, and rebuked, and moſt unworthy to be eſteem'd by others, at

Let thoſe Characters be intended of whomſoever (for I ſhall not pretend to know of whom they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but I have found them ſomwhere) methinks the men of ſuch a Complexion and Conſtitution as they ſeem to deſcribe, muſt needs be ſome of thoſe men that were <hi>well-willers</hi> to the death of <hi>King Charles the Martyr.</hi> For they can never love <hi>Kings</hi> well, who would be <hi>Kings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>John</hi> 19.12. <hi>Whoſoever maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a King, ſpeaketh againſt Caeſar.</hi>

                  <p>Sixthly, But that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould be ſo hearty for the King's Murther, as it ſhould ſeem they or ſome of them were, is not that the wonder of all wonders?

                  <p>Her upon, methinks, I hear ſome ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, But what is the King's death to us, who had not the leaſt finger in the death of the murthered King? What is that to us? <hi>Let them look to it,</hi> as was ſaid to <hi>Judas,</hi> when in deſpair. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many ways and circumſtances whereby a man
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42196:99"/>that was not <hi>principally</hi> concern'd, yet may be brought in as truly <hi>acceſſary</hi> to the Kings death, or to any ſuch thing as it was, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Connivendo.</hi> 2. <hi>Non reprehendendo.</hi> 3. <hi>Non praeveniendo.</hi> 4 <hi>Non dolendo.</hi> 5. <hi>Demeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> 6. <hi>Non deprecando.</hi> 7. <hi>Imitando.</hi> 8. <hi>Non detestando ſatis, &amp; contra proteſtando.</hi> 9. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocando.</hi> 10. <hi>Non puntendo cum poſſumus.</hi> 'Tis much to be feared, that this whole Nation may come in for a ſhare in the Kings death thus remotely, or upon account of one or other of the foreſaid particulars: For 1. <hi>Some did as it were connive at it when it was in fieri,</hi> or bringing about, <hi>and dic not do all they could have done to prevent it.</hi> Now to ſuch that paſſage, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.15, 16. may be applied, <hi>David ſaid to Abner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou not kept thy Lord the King? For there came one of the people in to deſtroy the King thy Lord. As the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to die, becauſe ye have not kpt your Maſter the Lords Anointed: And now ſee where the Kings ſpear is, and the cruſe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was at his Bolſter.</hi> Was not old <hi>Eli</hi> therefore charged with the ſins of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Children, <hi>becauſe his Sons made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13.

The old Armor of Chriſtians, which are <hi>Prayers and Tears</hi> ought to have been taken up by all men, and managed to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the defence of his Majeſty's life. If that were not done, you were <hi>remotely</hi> acceſſary to his death. 3. If you did not ſufficiently lay that to heart, mourn over, and bewail it, you are in ſome degree guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerning it. So had <hi>Lot</hi> been of the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> if he had not <hi>vexed his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſoul with the ungodly converſation of that place</hi> (as he is ſaid to have done, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.) The Apoſtle chargeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Inceſtuous man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. ſaying, <hi>Ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he who hath done this thing might be taken away from among you.</hi> God ſent his Angel, as we read, <hi>Ezek</hi> 9.4. to ſet a <hi>mark</hi> (of preſervation) <hi>upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of the men that ſighed and cried for the abominations done in the midſt of Jeruſalem,</hi> and upon them only: as who ſhould ſay, the reſt were involved in the common guilt. 4. If we have not duly <hi>reproved</hi> and <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended</hi> ſuch as had a hand in the <hi>King's</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42196:100"/>death, according to what opportunities we have had ſo to do; labouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the horrible evil and ſin of which they were guilty, and to call them to repentance then are we in part guilty of, and acceſſary to it our ſelves. So much is intended in that paſſage of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the fruits of darkneſs, but rather reprove them;</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they who reprove them not, are reckoned by God to have part or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them. 5. If we have not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently deteſted the putting of the King to death, and ſeaſonably entred a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it; ſurely we are in part guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. <hi>David</hi> hath an expreſſion to that purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.3. <hi>I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that the only way to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of other mens turnings aſide, or ſins to cleave to him, was for him to hate their wayes: and as for entring our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt other mens ſins, ſee how careful <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was to clear himſelf by doing that, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24 14, 15. <hi>Put away the gods which your Fathers ſerved in Egypt, and ſerve ye the Lord. And if it ſeem evil to ſerve the Lord, chuſe ye this day whom ye will ſerve; but as for me, I and my houſe will

They who do any ways provoke, ſtir up, or encourage others to a ſin, the acting whereof they themſelves do not touch with the leaſt of their fingers, are for that reaſon guilty of that ſin. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that moſt remarkable paſſage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.35. <hi>The Lord plagued the people becauſe they made the Calf that Aaron made.</hi> The people are ſaid to have made it, becauſe they put <hi>Aaron</hi> upon the making of it. 7. They who were any ways contributing and aſſiſting towards the death of the King, though ignorantly, and far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally, or to any of thoſe things which did make way for the acting and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of that bloody Tragedy, were in part acceſſary to his death. As the men <hi>who broke off the golden ear-rings which were in the ears of their wives and daughters, and brought them to Aaron, therewith to make a golden Calf,</hi> are therefore ſaid to have made that Calf, though they made it not a Calf, but only <hi>Aaron</hi> gave it a form and ſhape, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.20. <hi>And Moſes took the Calf which they</hi> (i. e. the people) <hi>had made, and burnt it.

                  <p>Now I am very prone to think that the <hi>Acceſſorineſs</hi> of men to the ſins of others in ſuch way and manner as hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, is one of the beſt accounts that can be given why God puniſheth ſome men for other mens ſins; <hi>ex. gr. Iſrael and Judah for David's numbring of the people,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. Particularly for men's <hi>juſtifying the ſins of others,</hi> by treading in their ſteps, and doing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42196:101"/>wickedly as they did before them, which is very provoking to God; witneſs <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.13, 14. <hi>The Lords anger was kindled againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and he made them wander in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs forty years,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And behold ye are riſen up in your Fathers ſtead, an increaſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord againſt Iſrael.</hi> Poſſibly one main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God's imputing <hi>Original ſin</hi> to any beſides him that committed it (and whoſe <hi>actual</hi> ſin it was) is becauſe men do <hi>juſtifie</hi> the ſame by their <hi>actual tranſgreſſions.</hi> For if <hi>Adam</hi> did not do well in doing what God had forbad him; why do we the ſame thing, preſuming from day to day to eat as it were of <hi>forbidden fruit?</hi> Yea, I do veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that God never did and never will impute <hi>Original ſin</hi> to the eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of any one perſon, male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, that hath not or ſhall not riſe up and juſtifie the ſame by his or her <hi>actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now leſt the hearts of them, who were <hi>primarily, immediately, intentionally,</hi> and <hi>wilfully</hi> guilty of murthering <hi>King Charles the First,</hi> ſhould be hardned by hearing that almoſt every body had <hi>remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>indirectly</hi> a hand or <hi>finger</hi> in the death of that good King, give me leave to tell
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42196:102"/>you, that there is no compariſon betwixt the greatneſs of their guilt who are the <hi>principal Actors</hi> the wilful and deliberate Contrivers and Executots of ſuch a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fact as that was; and of others, who by ſome of the ways before-mentioned are become, ſore againſt their will and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and beyond all that they could ever imagine, in ſome ſort <hi>Acceſſary</hi> to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely concern'd in it, and at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance guilty of the ſame. It was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by a <hi>Lye</hi> of <hi>David</hi>'s, that as we read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.18. <hi>The King</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Saul) <hi>ſaid to Doeg, Turn thou and fall upon the Prieſts. And Doeg went and fell upon the Prieſts; and ſlew on that day fourſcore and five perſons that did wear a linnen Ephod.</hi> ver. 19. <hi>And Nob the City of the Prieſts ſmote he with the edge of the ſword, both men and women, children and ſucklings, and oxen, aſſes, and ſheep.</hi> Hear <hi>David's</hi> Confeſſion, <hi>ver:</hi> 22. that it was long of him; <hi>David ſaid to Abiathar, I knew it that day when Doeg was there, that he would ſurely tell Saul, I have occaſioned the death of all the perſons of thy Fathers houſe.</hi> Now had <hi>David</hi> been as deeply guilty of the death of ſo many Prieſts, and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as <hi>Saul</hi> was, who commanded <hi>Doeg</hi> to kill them, or as <hi>Doeg</hi> was, who did ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42196:102"/>execute that bloody command of <hi>Saul</hi> directly oppoſite to the Command of God, 'tis like he had been overwhelm'd with the ſenſe of it; but as the caſe ſtood, he was not ſo, becauſe, though he was not altogether unacceſſary to the ſlaughter aforeſaid, yet he had ſo ſmall a hand in it, and was ſo very <hi>remotely, indirectly,</hi> and <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intentionally</hi> concern'd therein, that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had not much to ſay to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. For it fareth in ſuch caſes as theſe, as it doth in ſome ſmall and ſlender <hi>Errors in judgment,</hi> which may be charged with dangerous <hi>Conſequences</hi> at the long run, they may poſſibly be no great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to theſe that hold them, or are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, becauſe they do utterly abhor thoſe <hi>Conſequences</hi> wherewith they are charged, neither do they apprehend that they are chargeable with any ſuch <hi>Conſequences. Ex. gr.</hi> Suppoſe that be an Error that ſome have made ſuch ill uſe of, <hi>That Chriſt ſhall reign upon the earth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years,</hi> though <hi>Fifth monarchy-men</hi> have taken occaſion from thence to <hi>raiſe Arms</hi> and <hi>rebel,</hi> under pretence of bringing Chriſt to his Throne, yet ought not all that ever were of that opinion, or now are, to be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Rebels.</hi> For there are and have been men
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42196:103"/>of that perſwaſion, who knew full well that the Kingdom of Chriſt upon Earth ſtood in no need of mens ſins and Rebellion to ſet it up, but would make way for its ſelf when the full time was come. God forbid, that I ſhould be ſo unjuſt as to charge every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with the death of the <hi>martyred King,</hi> at any ſuch rate as his Judges are charged with it; but this I am bold to ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that the whole Nation, at leaſtwiſe by <hi>deſerving</hi> that ſo great a judgment ſhould befal it, as was the cutting off a good <hi>King,</hi> or by not ſufficiently <hi>bewailing</hi> that ſuch a thing was done, or notenough abhorring the tſinfulneſs of that fact, are become ſo far forth <hi>acceſſary</hi> to it, as doth give every man ſufficient occaſion to caſt in his Lot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that do faſt and mourn upon every 30th. day of <hi>January.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, methinks, I hear ſome people objecting againſt the <hi>Law</hi> which hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a perpetual Faſt upon that occaſion to be celebrated every year, and on ſuch a day; as if it were a thing of which no good account could be given, or more than needs, and concerning which the great God would ſay, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> As if it did but kindle coals, keep up revenge, renew heats and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42196:103"/>animoſities, raiſe and diſturb the Ghoſts of the dead, which ſhould be at reſt; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid thoſe who have received their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and upon the whole matter do more hurt than good. Now to thoſe who ask us, <hi>Quo warranto</hi> do we keep our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Faſt</hi> on every 30th day of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi> To that I anſwer: 1. We have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſtances in holy Writ, of Magiſtrates taking upon them to appoint <hi>Religious Faſts,</hi> 1 Sam. 7.5. <hi>And Samuel ſaid, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Iſrael to Mizepeh: And they gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and faſted all that day, &amp;c.</hi> (Which paſſage the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> doth thus gloſs upon, <hi>viz. Hauſerunt aquas e puteo cordis ſui &amp; abunde lachrymati ſunt coram Domino, reſipiſcentes, i. e.</hi> They drew waters out of the wells of their hearts, and wept abundantly before the Lord; but that by the way.) See alſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Jehoſhaphat feared</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> were come up againſt him) <hi>and ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaimed a Faſt throughout Judah.</hi> See alſo <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.21. <hi>Then I proclaimed a Faſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ezra</hi>) <hi>that we might afflict our ſelves before our God, to ſeek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our ſubſtance.</hi> Alſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42196:104"/>
                     <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.16. <hi>Go gather together all the Jews that are in Shuſhan</hi> (ſaid Queen <hi>Heſter</hi>) <hi>and faſt ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day; I alſo and my maids will faſt likewiſe, and ſo will I go in unto the King, which is not according to the Law, and if I periſh, I periſh.</hi> See <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5. <hi>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Faſt.</hi> ver. 6. <hi>For word came to the King of Nineveh, and he covered him with ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and ſate in aſhes. And he cauſed it to be proclaimed and publiſhed thorow Nineveh, by the decree of the King and his Nobles, &amp;c.</hi> All theſe Texts do manifeſt beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, That even the beſt of Rulers and Magiſtrates, ſuch as <hi>Samuel, Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, Ezra,</hi> &amp;c. have taken upon them to proclaim and enjoyn <hi>Religious Faſts</hi> when they ſaw cauſes for it: which doubtleſs ſo good and knowing men as theſe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done, if it had not belonged to them. So then, there can be no fault in Magiſtrates aſſuming to themſelves to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Faſt, and Faſts, upon ſufficient and meet occaſions; though ſome cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear of Civil Magiſtrates their med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or making, more or leſs, about matters of Religion, no though it be to promote it; but I think they are more nice than wiſe in that particular.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:42196:104"/>
                  <p>But may ſome ſay, Will the occaſion bear a Faſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Death of the King ſo many years ago? To which I anſwer, Why not? Surely it will. Great Judgments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incumbent or but impendent have been the occaſions of <hi>Faſts.</hi> So of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi>'s and of <hi>Eſther</hi>'s Faſt; and why are not great ſins as much and as juſt an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Faſt, for they are cauſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of great Judgments? Have we not as much cauſe to faſt and pray in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that <hi>Guilt</hi> which is upon our heads, as to <hi>War</hi> or other Calamities, which do but hang or hover over our heads? Now whereas ſome may think that though ſuch an occaſion as that may well bear a day or two once for all, yet an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary Faſt</hi> upon ſuch an account as this is too much. I am not of their mind: For why not Anniverſary Faſts upon great and and publick <hi>ſins,</hi> as well as <hi>Anniverſary Feaſts</hi> upon great and publick deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? and that appointed by Magiſtrates too? Such was the Feaſt of <hi>Purim, i. e.</hi> of <hi>Lots,</hi> which was inſtituted by <hi>Mordecai,</hi> (who you know was a very good man) in remembrance of the <hi>Jews</hi> delivery from <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, before whom Lots were caſt from day to day for the deſtruction of them.</hi> We read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42196:105"/>of an <hi>Anniverſary Feaſt,</hi> called the <hi>Feaſt of Dedication,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>God hath given us ſtanding general Rules for ſet days of Faſting or Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as the matter ſhall require; but hath left it to the Rulers of the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> to appoint the time, whether every year, or as they pleaſe, and made it our duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them in it, as in all other lawful things. God forbid that we ſhould not obey the Magiſtrate in thoſe Commands of his in which he obeys God; and ſurely he obeys God in commanding thoſe things to be done which God alſo hath commanded, or for which he hath given general Rules to be applied to particular times and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42196:105"/>places, as the Magiſtrate ſhall think fit</p>
                  <p>If any do think that the Faſt which I am now ſpeaking of, is meerly <hi>a Fast for ſtrife and for ſmiting with the fiſt.</hi> I utterly deny that any ſuch thing doth appear to have been the Magiſtrates intent in appointing it, neither ought we to be ſo uncharitable as to think ſo, neither is there any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making it to be ſo. For upon that day we call to remembrance a great and ſhameful ſin which divers men have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for, yet it is not to make their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more odious, whoſe lives have paid for what they did, but to ſtigmatize their <hi>fact,</hi> that the like may never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this or any ſucceeding age; it is not to make the <hi>Murtherers infamous,</hi> but the <hi>Murther,</hi> the <hi>Regicide,</hi> to cauſe that to ſtink in the Noſtrils of all men. 'Tis not to grieve the hearts of their ſurviving Relations, <hi>Widows,</hi> or <hi>Children,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, it is to grieve no body that had no hand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the death of that <hi>excellent</hi> King; but it is, <hi>that others may hear and do no more ſo wickedly.</hi>

                  <p>I look upon a 30th. <hi>day of January</hi> to be the moſt proper day in all the year to preach up <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and to preach <hi>down Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the cloſe of all, If any man ſhall ſay to me, <hi>Cui bono?</hi> or <hi>Quorſum haec?</hi> To what purpoſe is it for any man to ſet
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42196:106"/>forth the <hi>murthering of the late King</hi> in its colours (as you have done) ſince the thing is paſt and gone, and cannot be recall'd, and now there is no help for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To that I anſwer, By the ſame reaſon may you think it needleſs to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance any great <hi>ſin</hi> of your own; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is paſt and gone, and now there is no help for it, To what purpoſe ſhould I mourn over it? any more than <hi>David</hi> did over his Child, when perfectly dead? or why ſhould not I rather do as he then did, of whom it is ſaid, That <hi>when the child was dead he waſhed and anointed himſelf, and changed his Apparel, and eat bread,</hi> 2 Sam. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, Though we ought to <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> as little as we can for thoſe <hi>Afflictions</hi> which are gone over our heads, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be recall'd, and to forget them as ſoon as we can, yet it ought not to be ſo with us, ſuch ought not to be our carriage, in reference to our <hi>ſins: David</hi> ſaith, That <hi>his ſins were ever before him.</hi> Who ever condemn'd <hi>Peter</hi> for weeping, after the <hi>crowing</hi> Cock cauſed him to reflect upon his <hi>denying</hi> his Maſter?

                  <p>The wiſdom of his Grandfather <hi>King James,</hi> as being one of the greateſt <hi>Royal Scholars</hi> that ever was, began early to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for the warm Sun of ſo literate an Education quickly brought him to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Are not all publick <hi>Ordinations, Adminiſtration of Sacraments,</hi> and other Church-Offices diſpenſed after the manner of <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> Are not the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> defended by his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> and are not they all purely <hi>Froteſtant?</hi> Thoſe things conſidered, who can deny his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to be really <hi>a Defender of the Faith?</hi> And why ſhould any man go about <hi>to clip his Title,</hi> any more than he dare to <hi>clip his Coin?</hi> May he not be truly a <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> though he be no <hi>Defender</hi> of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> either <hi>Scotch</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor yet of <hi>Independency,</hi> nor of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> nor of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> nor of <hi>Fifth-Monarchiſm?</hi> I ſay, though he be no Defender of any of them
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42196:116"/>in the <hi>Abſtract</hi> (but only of their perſons in the <hi>Concrete,</hi> who are of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions) I ſay, he may be <hi>a Defender of the Faith nevertheleſs,</hi> and ſo he is, for none of theſe are <hi>the Faith:</hi> Theſe are but <hi>Mint, Anniſe,</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> in reſpect of the great things of Religion, the <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> the two Tables of the Law, of which he is Keeper. Thoſe are but the arbitrary <hi>Modes, Habits,</hi> and <hi>Dreſſes</hi> of Religion. Clothes do not belong to the eſſence of a man. A man is a man to all intents and purpoſes, whether he wear a <hi>Cloak</hi> or <hi>a Coat,</hi> or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or both. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is the ſame thing in all good men, whether they wear <hi>Gowns</hi> or no <hi>Gowns, Caſſocks</hi> or no <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocks,</hi> and who are called either <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal, Presbyterian, Independent,</hi> or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe. So long as the <hi>eſſentials, Vitals</hi> and <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Religion are guarded by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the vigilant care of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> what becomes of thoſe little <hi>airy vehicles</hi> of diſciplinary names, diviſions, and diſtinctions is the leaſt thing of a thouſand. For ſo long as a man <hi>lays no other foundation than that which God hath lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> viz. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.11. building up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by <hi>faith, love,</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> if he ſhould chuſe beſides <hi>Gold, and ſilver, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42196:116"/>precious ſtones, to build upon the foundation wood, hay, and ſtubble, that his ſuperstructure would be burnt, yet himſelf ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved.</hi> If a man may go to heaven out of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well, yea, more readily than from <hi>Geneva</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and from under the Diſcipline of any of thoſe places, let him look to it that he be a good Chriſtian, <hi>exerciſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have a Conſcience void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and men;</hi> one <hi>that worſhippeth God in the ſpirit, rejoyceth in Christ Jeſus, and has no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. and my Soul for his, <hi>having thus his fruit unto holineſs, his end will be everlasting life.</hi> So a man come to Heaven at laſt, <hi>fighting a good fight, finiſhing a good courſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kept the faith</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> having been true to the great Doctrine and Rules of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion defended by the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and his <hi>Majeſty</hi> more eſpecially, <hi>the Supreme Governor thereof under God</hi>) by a ſincere life and practice thereof, I ſay, if a man perſevering thus to do, come to Heaven at laſt, whether he come in the <hi>Kings high way</hi> (as I may call it) I mean, in the more eminent and beaten Road of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy,</hi> or in the more private, narrow, and unfrequented paths, the matter is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42196:117"/>not great. But I make account no man can ever come there, who ſhall live and dye an incourager of known <hi>Schiſme</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (which is as truly a damning <hi>work of the fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Adultery</hi> or <hi>Murther</hi>) or a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful allower of it in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>'Tis no complement, much leſs flattery or blaſphemy, to call him <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> by whom as much of Religion as is neceſſary to Salvation is defended, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we his Subjects in the free and ſafe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof, though the ſame favour be not ſhewn to thoſe who turn aſide from the only eſtabliſhed Diſcipline (for but one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline can be eſtabliſhed in one place) as to thoſe who conform thereunto. If a man travel upon the <hi>Kings high way</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Sun and Sun, and be rob'd, he may ſue and recover his Money: but ſo may not he that travelleth in By-roads, or croſs the Country, or over hedges and ditches. I ſay, if any man rob them that ſhall chuſe to travel in ſuch by, obſcure, and unguarded paths, no amends is made him; only if he chance to be kill'd or murder'd in any wood or wilderneſs, the Law will lay hold on him that did it. Let who will govern, or the Government be what it will be, they who conform thereunto will always find
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42196:117"/>more regard and countenance than thoſe who do not, though others may be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and protected alſo. And ſo much of our <hi>Kings</hi> being <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly ſo called, upon account whereof we have cauſe to bleſs God for him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9thly. We have cauſe to give thanks to God for thoſe <hi>Kings,</hi> by and under whom all the <hi>great ends of Government are</hi> provided for, and therefore for his Majeſty that now is. By him all the <hi>great ends of Government</hi> are provided for. What are they, but in two words, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Property?</hi> How <hi>Religion</hi> ot the preſervation thereof, and our protection in the profeſſion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof are provided for, I ſhew'd under the 8th, and laſt head. 'Tis manifeſt that care is taken that <hi>we may lead a quiet and peaceble life in all godlineſs and honeſty,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. Alſo how <hi>Property</hi> is ſecured to us, may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundantly out of the formentioned particulars. Now if you have any thing more to expect from a <hi>King,</hi> declare what it is: For I confeſs I know nothing elſe that there is for him to do as a <hi>King</hi> for us, or for us as his Subjects to expect.</p>
                  <p n="10">10thly, and laſtly, I do ſolemnly appeal to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42196:118"/>the diſcontented people of the Nation, and to thoſe whoſe mouths are moſt full of complaints; I ſay, I appeal to them in two caſes, which I ſhall propound in the two following Queſtions. 1. Queſt. <hi>If you meet with leſs miſery, enjoy more mercy under his Majeſty that now is, than ye did expect or look for, have you not cauſe to bleſs God for him?</hi> Queſt. 2. <hi>Do you not really meet with leſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and more mercy under his Majesty that now is, than you thought you ſhould have done?</hi> How oft have I heard many that were <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamenteers</hi> ſay, If ever the <hi>King</hi> were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they ſhould not be left worth a morſel of bread, there would be no being for them then in <hi>England,</hi> he would make the Land too hot for them, and all ſuch as they. They had as good buy <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Deans and Chapters</hi> Lands as not, for if a change came, they ſhould as certainly loſe their Lands of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and what they got by their own labour, and was as free as any in the world, as <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> Lands, if they intended to buy them. I know that many did look upon the King's return as the giving up the Ghoſt of all their joys and comforts, poſſeſſions and enjoyments. But did it prove ſo? Have not many of them ſeen as good days as
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42196:118"/>ever they ſaw before? Where is the <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> you propheſied of, that would come in preſently? For you ſaw it <hi>flying</hi> towards <hi>us, as upon the wings of the wind?</hi> Where has been the <hi>bloody Perſecution,</hi> the <hi>Marian</hi>-days which your minds boded to you? Have you not ſince that ſeen <hi>days of Grace and Peace, and of the Son of man?</hi> Is the <hi>Ark taken,</hi> as you thought it would be? Is <hi>God gone?</hi> Is the <hi>Glory departed?</hi> Is the Goſpel extinguiſhed? and the Sun ſet as it were at Noon day, as you fancied it would be? O leave your dreaming of Dreams, and divining of Divinations; away with thoſe <hi>hypocondriack vapours which turn to new Light and Prophecy.</hi> Silence and ſlight your miſtaken fancies: <hi>Your eyes yet ſee your Teachers, and your ears hear them. Now, even now, there is an accepted time, a day of Salvation.</hi> You were worſe ſcar'd than hurt with the Alarm of a <hi>King:</hi> Such is not the manner of the <hi>King</hi> that rules over us, as is deſcribed 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.9. ours is no ſuch <hi>King.</hi> Are not your <hi>Eſtates</hi> (all but thoſe that were raviſhed from the Church or State) continued with you? Is not the Law open and ready to defend you and yours if required, as much as any other of the Kings Subjects? If you be as quiet,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42196:119"/>may you not live as quietly as any people in <hi>England?</hi> To allude to that Text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1. <hi>When the Lord turned again the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are you not like men and women in a dream to ſee your ſelves in ſo good a plight and poſture as you never expected to have been if God reſtor'd the King? Had God given you a new Law of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs upon condition it ſhould have been ſo well with you as now it is, would you not have accepted it with all your hearts upon thoſe terms? If God has been better to you than his word or promiſe, your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is ſo much the greater.</p>
                  <p>Learn we then to bleſs God for our good <hi>King,</hi> to <hi>love, honour,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him; and let us cry out with the man after God's own heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118, 28. <hi>God is the Lord which hath ſhewed us light, bind the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with cords, even to the horns of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi> ver. 29. <hi>O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> let thine own invention tell thee how theſe heads may be further enlarged, and upon what other heads it may be moſt proper for thee to diſcourſe, either in publick or private upon <hi>a</hi> 30th. <hi>day
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42196:119"/>of January</hi> ſacred to the Memory of King <hi>Charles the firſt his Martyrdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will detain thee no longer, than whilſt I have made a little enquiry into one great <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and reſolved one perplexing Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which is this: Queſt. <hi>If the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the late King were ſo great a ſin as I have deciphereed it to be, How comes it to paſs that none of all his Judges (one excepted, who by common fame is preſumed to be a man of more Conſcience and Religion than the reſt) no not of thoſe who were executed for it, were ever, for ought I heard, learn to confeſs and bewail what they had done, but rather to carry and brave it out with ſuch confidence and ſeeming innocence as the adulterous woman,</hi> Prov. 30.20. of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> thus ſpeaks: <hi>She eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith I have done no wickedneſs.</hi> This their confidence hath caſt ſuch a miſt before the eyes of ſome people, and ſo perverted their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to make them think there was nothing amiſs in what they did, yea, to be almoſt perſwaded, that <hi>they did God good ſervice in it,</hi> and quitted themſelves like <hi>Phineas, who ſtood up and executed judgment, and it was accounted to him for righteuſneſs. Anſw.</hi> But oh the miſtakes of men! Oh the falſe Gloſſes which dazle the eyes of poor
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42196:120"/>filly mortals! Oh the common fallacy which impoſeth upon the world, <hi>viz. Non cauſa pro cauſa!</hi> They muſt needs have had the moſt falſe and flattering Conſciences, the moſt deceitful hearts that ever men had, if ever they preſum'd to tell them they had done well, or bid them, when taking their <hi>Viaticum,</hi> or laſt repaſt, to <hi>eat their bread with joy, and drink their wine with a merry heart, for God accepted their work,</hi> or that with <hi>ſuch a ſacrifice</hi> as that <hi>God was well pleaſed.</hi> Had an <hi>Iſraelite inſtead of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Lamb, cut off a dogs neck, or offered Swines blood for an oblation to God, or bleſs'd an Idol inſtead of burning incenſe, or ſlain a man inſtead of killing of an Oxe,</hi> as God expreſſes in <hi>Ifa.</hi> 66.3. he might as well have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf Gods acceptance thereof, and <hi>his ſmelling a ſweet ſavour of reſt</hi> from thence, as thoſe <hi>Murtherers</hi> of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>King</hi> could do of that bloody <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sacrifice</hi> which they had prepared; to which I may aptly apply thoſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. <hi>But I ſay, the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Devils and not to God. No drink-offering</hi> ever cheer'd the heart of <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>wicked men,</hi> ſo well (according to <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.13.) as did that of <hi>Royal Blood.</hi> If ever
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42196:120"/>there were mirth in Hell, ſurely it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that day. That was ſuch a <hi>Hecatomb,</hi> as the infernall Fiends never had a greater offered to them; never a <hi>Feaſt of more fat things</hi> ſacrificed to their malice.</p>
                  <p>That they who were the Actors in this bloody Tragedy were no more ſenſible of what they had done, might ſpring from two cauſes. 1. Becauſe the ſin, being ſo great and horrid as it was, might well bring a kind of <hi>Apoplexy</hi> upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and in ſome ſuch <hi>apoplectick Fit,</hi> they, or ſome of them, ſeem'd to dye. For great <hi>ſins,</hi> as well as great <hi>ſorrows,</hi> and <hi>blows</hi> are apt to <hi>ſtun and ſtupifie,</hi> as I proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 2. Becauſe there were <hi>many of them</hi> that were concern'd in it, and it might ſeem to them to be in this as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes, <hi>viz. That many hands make light work. 'Tis a very true and common obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when a great many men joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they go as it were in herds and droves, they do often venture upon doing of thoſe things by conſent, which were they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to do alone, they would be ready to ſay as he, Is thy Servant a dead dog, that I ſhould do this thing?</hi> One would think men were deceived with ſome ſuch idle fallacy as this, <hi>viz.</hi> That if an hundred men joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42196:121"/>in one Murther, or other high act of <hi>Injustice</hi> or <hi>Diſhoneſty,</hi> every one of them were but the hundredth part of a Murtherer; as if <hi>multorum manibus grande levatur onus,</hi> were a Rule that held in this caſe, but as thus applied, it is a very great miſtake: For what our Law ſaith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to right Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no man is meer acceſſary, but all are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals and obnoxious to death.</hi> Shall I add a third. This their ſin was not ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>gone before to judgment,</hi> as is a plain ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Murther, becauſe it was coloured o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a pretence of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> there were a great many that were ready not only to <hi>vindicate</hi> but <hi>applaud</hi> it; the mask was not quite taken off from it, nor the <hi>vail of darkneſs from</hi> the hearts of all the Spectators. This with a good <hi>ſtrong Cordial,</hi> a ſufficient <hi>opiate,</hi> and a <hi>ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and an <hi>ambition to ſet a good face</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what they had done, to <hi>make the beſt of a bad market,</hi> to dye like <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and thoſe that ſome would not doubt to Canonize for <hi>Saints,</hi> even for the ſake of their <hi>Regicide</hi> (could they but keep their own counſel, by dying ſuch in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and ſeeming Aſſurance) thoſe with ſome other things I could name, might
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42196:121"/>be the true cauſes why they did or ſeem'd to die without the leaſt remorſe for what they had done. <hi>But far be it from us to think the better, or more favourably of that ſin, the committers whereof did or ſeem'd to dye without repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what I have written touching this matter, <hi>I call Heaven to witneſs,</hi> did not ſpring from any hatred that I do, or ever did bear to the perſons of them, or theirs who had the <hi>infamous honour,</hi> or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour, but eternal infamy of being the King's <hi>Judges;</hi> but from deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>fact,</hi> and a true deſire that the like may be prevented for time to come; and wheras it is commonly ſaid, that <hi>ſome do love Treaſon but always hate the Traytors;</hi> I by a <hi>reverſe,</hi> do profeſs my ſelf to have heartily <hi>pitied</hi> the perſons of thoſe <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> to have true compaſſion and good will to their innocent Relations that yet ſurvive them; but mean time from my heart to abhor and deteſt that and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did I ſay that as much as I hate <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> I have heartily pitied and do pity the <hi>Regicides,</hi> I do not mean that I think it any pity, that being what they were, they ſhould be brought to an untimely end, to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42196:122"/>an ignominious death, that I thought them too good to be <hi>hanged, drawn,</hi> and <hi>quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> who had been ſo vile as to <hi>behead</hi> their <hi>King;</hi> all that they ſuffered in that nature was far leſs than they deſerved. But I do really pity them in relation to their <hi>poor Souls:</hi> For <hi>I wiſh</hi> from my heart, <hi>that all men might be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> and <hi>am not willing</hi> if I could help it) <hi>that any ſhould periſh everlaſtingly:</hi> I wiſh no man ſo ill as to wiſh him in hell, or that he might die in his ſins, that the bottomleſs pit might open its mouth and ſwallow him up. Sure I am, the <hi>Regicides</hi> did run as great a risk and bid as fair for <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> as men could do by any one action, their fact being ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and complicatedly wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable as it was. Had they courted <hi>Hell,</hi> and been fond of <hi>Damnation,</hi> what could they have done more to have enjoyed it, than to bain their own Souls, as much as in them lay, by an eternal Poyſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of all ſorts of deadly Ingredients, one of which might ſeem ſufficient to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the work in ſpight of an Antidote. The great compounded Antidotes, <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, &amp;c.</hi> do hardly conſiſt of more Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacal Ingredients than this fact of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42196:122"/>theirs did of deleterious, and deadly things (or ſhall I call them <hi>damnable Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>For firſt, Is <hi>Perjury</hi> a damning ſin, or is it not? If not, what mean theſe words of St. <hi>James,</hi> Jac. 5.12. <hi>Above all things ſwear not, neither by the Heaven nor by the Earth, nor by any other Oath, but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, lest you fall into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now in theſe words <hi>ſwearing,</hi> but <hi>vainly</hi> and frivolouſly, and that <hi>but by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth, or other Creatures,</hi> ſeems to be threatned with <hi>damnation;</hi> and is it not far worſe and more damnable to <hi>ſwear falſely,</hi> and that by the Name of God, than to ſwear <hi>frivolouſly</hi> by the Name of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? yet even the later of thoſe doth St. <hi>James</hi> deprecate with the moſt earneſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation: <hi>Above all things, my brethren, ſwear not, neither by Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Is there no <hi>damnableneſs</hi> in <hi>Rebellion</hi> think you? No danger that Rebellion ſhould damn any man? Is that a <hi>venial</hi> and no <hi>mortal</hi> ſin? Surely no: Witneſs the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, reſiſteth the Ordinances of God, and they that reſiſt them, receive to themſelves damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now in this caſe there was <hi>reſiſting unto blood.</hi>

                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42196:123"/>3. Was no man ever damn'd for <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> What think you of <hi>Judas</hi> who was a <hi>Traytor</hi> to his Maſter and Saviour; of whom the Scripture ſaith, <hi>It had been good for him that he had never been born.</hi> If he went to Heaven, if he were not damn'd, it was well for him that ever he was born: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe words do intimate that he was <hi>damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Can <hi>Sacriledge</hi> damn no man? Is not that of its ſelf a <hi>damnable</hi> ſin? Surely it is.

So was the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Sacriledge</hi> of ſome men is their robbing of God, not of what they themſelves, but of that which others have made God's by a <hi>Vow.</hi> Now even they do fall under a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible curſe or <hi>execration.</hi> Things given or devoted unto God, called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">5ly. Is <hi>Murther, wilful murther</hi> a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſin? If not, why ſaith St. <hi>John, Ye know that no murtherer hath eternal life abiding in him; i. e.</hi> hath any actual aptitude or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to enter into Heaven. Now if the <hi>murthering</hi> of any man, be he good or bad, high or low, ſuperiour or inferiour, be a damnable ſin, ſure I am the murthering of an <hi>innocent good man,</hi> yea, of a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>good King,</hi> which are great aggravations, muſt be ſo too. Yea, if the wilful murthering of any one man expoſe to damnation, much more needs muſt the murthering of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men at once.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Regicides</hi> may be ſaid to have been all of them murtherers each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they did abet and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage each other in and unto the <hi>murther</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> in which was included their own conſequentially. If there were forty of them, each of them was guilty of the death of forty, not the forty only guilty of the death of one man <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>King;</hi> but each of them of forty <hi>murthers, viz.</hi> each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for that they ſtrengthened each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands in and unto the work.</p>
                  <p>Again, If <hi>naked Murther</hi> be a damnable
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42196:124"/>ſin, as hath been proved, that murther which is <hi>cloathed</hi> with <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> circumſtances muſt needs be ſo much more. In <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.25. we read of a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> Concubine not only killed, but with circumſtances that were very <hi>barbarous,</hi> viz. <hi>forced to death</hi> by the <hi>Benjamites</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Gibeah, Chap.</hi> 20.5. But what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things enſued, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite) took my Concubine, and cut her in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſent her through all Iſrael, for they have committed lewdneſs and folly in Iſrael.</hi> The product of this was what we read, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.34, 35. <hi>And there came up againſt Gibeah ten thouſand choſen men out of all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and the battle was ſore. And the Lord ſmote Benjamin before Iſrael, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael deſtroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and four thouſand, and an hundred men, all theſe drew the ſword,</hi> or were <hi>men of valour,</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. Though wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful murther it ſelf, cloathed with the moſt extenuating circumſtances be a great ſin; yet the <hi>barbarous circumſtances</hi> wherewith it may be cloathed, may make it twice ſo great a ſin as otherwiſe it had been, and much more expoſe it to the Divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as appeareth by the inſtance afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. But to proceed,</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:42196:125"/>6thly. Is <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> a <hi>damning ſin</hi> or not? It muſt needs be ſo, becauſe <hi>Hell,</hi> or the place <hi>of weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a portion with the Hypocrite,</hi> Matth. 24.51. intimating that <hi>Tophet</hi> was prepared of old as much for <hi>Hypocrites</hi> as for any ſort of men. Doth not our Saviour let fly as many <hi>Vae's,</hi> or <hi>Woes</hi> againſt <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> as againſt any ſort of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14, 15, 16, 23, 25, 27, 29. and does he not utter thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words in the cloſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>Ye Serpents, ye generation of Vipers; how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> Now with what direful circumſtances of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> the late <hi>King's</hi> death was managed, I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="7">7thly. If it be a mortal <hi>damning ſin</hi> to murther but one man, eſpecially if a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Monarch,</hi> or any thing ſo great, is it not more, ſo to murther a whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Country and <hi>Monarchy</hi> at once? The whole <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Monarchy</hi> is much more than one individual <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Now I have ſhew'd before that was aim'd at in putting the <hi>King</hi> to death, which was not only <hi>Monarchicidium,</hi> but deſigned to iſſue in <hi>Monarchiaecidium,</hi> or in the ruine of all <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8thly. Is it not a horrid and damning ſin
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42196:125"/>to ſubvert and deſtroy the good and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>Laws</hi> of a Nation all at once? Yea. Not the Laws only, but alſo the very <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power,</hi> or the Power of making more good Laws, as the matter ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire? If they who <hi>reſiſt</hi> (or <hi>diſobey</hi>) <hi>the powers that are, ſhall receive damnation,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. What will become of them, who in effect deſtroy and diſanul all the <hi>Laws</hi> of a Nation at once, and all the Law-makers? Such were the <hi>Regicides.</hi> For when there was no <hi>King</hi> in <hi>England</hi> arm'd with power, no <hi>new Laws</hi> could be made, nor the old ones executed neither Legally; for who but a <hi>King</hi> has power to give Commiſſion to <hi>Judges</hi> and other great Inſtruments of the <hi>Law</hi> upon all emergent occaſions, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> What the Apoſtle ſaith of the Law of God, <hi>viz. The Law is good if a man uſe it lawfully;</hi> is true of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> it is good if it be uſed lawfully or legally; but how could that be done when there was no <hi>King</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
                  <p n="9">9thly. Is it not a damning ſin for a man to <hi>murther himſelf,</hi> as did <hi>Judas, Ahitophel,</hi> &amp;c? And did not they murther themſelves who murther'd the <hi>King?</hi> For beſides that they were <hi>dead</hi> men in the Eye of the Law,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42196:126"/>the firſt moment they <hi>did</hi> or <hi>attempted</hi> it; did it not coſt moſt of them their lives, and expoſe them to an untimely and ſhameful death, though no puniſhment could be ſo ſhameful as was their crime.</p>
                  <p n="10">10thly and laſtly. Is <hi>Deicidium,</hi> or <hi>ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the life of God himſelf</hi> a damning ſin? If that will not damn men without great repentance what will? The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of earthly Kings in <hi>Perſon,</hi> is it not a kind of murthering the King of Kings in <hi>Effigie?</hi> For his Stamp and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription they bear, and from thence are called <hi>gods</hi> in Scripture frequently; not that they are equal to the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, yea, not but that <hi>they ſhall die like men,</hi> but becauſe in point <hi>of Power and Authority, of Honour and Majeſty</hi> they do reſemble God much more than <hi>Subjects</hi> do. Now as he that ſhould ſpit upon the <hi>Kings Coin</hi> or <hi>Picture</hi> would be dealt with as one that offered an affront and indignity to his Perſon, and were highly diſaffected to him, ſo in this caſe. Now all thoſe Soul-damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins that I have mentioned, being in the womb of that one ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the late King, let the Reader judge whether the <hi>Regicides</hi> did not take as direct a courſe to damn their own Souls as men
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42196:126"/>could take? And whether if any ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after attempt to do the ſame thing to his Majeſty that now is, as they did to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which God forbid) it will not prove as ready and certain a courſe not only to throw away their corporal lives with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, but alſo to <hi>damn their Souls,</hi> and the Souls of their Confederates, as any that men could take.</p>
                  <p>I am hardned againſt thoſe that ſhall ſay (if any ſuch there be) That this was done in favour of Religion, and for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in power and purity; by a Story which a noted <hi>Parliament-man,</hi> and Purchaſer of the revenues of a <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> told me about the year 1648. <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is given out that all the change which hath been made has been in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Reformation of Religion, there is no ſuch thing. For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>had there been Preferments enough in Church &amp; State where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to have gratified all men of parts &amp; inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, who were ambitious of them, I do aſſure you, there had been no war.</hi> He was as capable of knowing what he ſaid, as any man could be, being at that time a <hi>Member of Parliament,</hi> and a great man amongſt them, though more plain-hearted than ſome others were.</p>
                  <p>The diſcoveries which I have made of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42196:127"/>notorious <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and blaſphemous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> whilſt men did <hi>uti Deo at fruantur mundo,</hi> i. e. <hi>uſe God that they might enjoy the world,</hi> together with the little difference, which I could ever diſcern betwixt the converſations of thoſe that called themſelves the <hi>Godly Party</hi> ſave in a few inſtances, here and there one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and of them whom they cenſured as <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> or but <hi>moral</hi> people at the beſt (for that the <hi>morality</hi> of ſome of them did much outſtrip their own) has put me out of conceit with what had wont to be called <hi>The Good Old Cauſe,</hi> more than any thing elſe has done. And then to ſee that the Chieftains and greateſt <hi>Bigots</hi> of, and for <hi>the good old Cauſe</hi> (as they call'd it) could <hi>ſwallow ſuch a Camel as was the murthering of the King;</hi> yea, be themſelves ſome of the <hi>Camels</hi> that murthered him, or cauſed him to be murthered, whilſt they ſeem'd <hi>to ſtrain at meer Gnats,</hi> could ſay, <hi>This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and the inheritance ſhall be ours.</hi> Thoſe I ſay, are the things which have made me think cheaply of thoſe <hi>times,</hi> thoſe men, and their pretenſions, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect (if not more than ſo) a very <hi>grand cheat</hi> and a bottomleſs-pit of worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and carnal deſign in and under all thoſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42196:127"/>things, and to wiſh heartily, that the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> might always continue as now it is, much rather than to fall back again into the hands of ſuch <hi>Tinker-like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi> as were in thoſe days (making ten holes where they mended one) and be re-invaded by hypocritical <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, Enthuſiaſme,</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi> If I know any thing of my own heart, I do at this very day ſincerely love every body that I know or think to be truly good (and poſſibly my charity is as large as moſt mens, and my cenſoriouſneſs as little) but as for thoſe who make the higheſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Religion, and ſeem to be <hi>Piety</hi>-like <hi>Calomelanos,</hi> as Phyſicians call it, ſix or 12 times ſublimed; or like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, who ſaid to other men, <hi>Stand off, I am holier than thou;</hi> who rather <hi>blaze</hi> and <hi>blare</hi> like great <hi>Comets,</hi> than ſhine like <hi>Stars</hi> in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of Religion; if I find them play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Knaves,</hi> becoming the <hi>Ring-leaders of Murther,</hi> embrewing their hands in <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood;</hi> under pretence of <hi>abhorring Idols committing Sacriledge,</hi> and bringing all to confuſion, and under colour of <hi>Reforming Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> to deſign nothing but the feathering of their own Neſts, getting wealth and power into their own hands <hi>per
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42196:128"/>fas &amp; nefas, overturning, overturning, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,</hi> till they themſelves, whoſe right it is not come and take all; and when they have done all, entitling God and Religion to all their Villanies: (like thoſe with whom the great God doth thus expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Will ye steal, murder, and commit Adultery, and ſwear falſly, and come and ſtand before me in this Houſe, and ſay, we are delivered to do all theſe abominations?</hi> &amp;c.) I ſay, the people to whom this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is due, whoſe Inſcription this is, are to my Soul (as one calls it) the <hi>firſt-born of Abominations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after all that hath been ſaid of the exceeding ſinfulneſs of their bloody fact, <hi>who were the Murtherers of the late King</hi> and of the woful hazard which their precious and immortal Souls did incur thereby, give me leave to hope, that if the ſame oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities ſhould ever come again (which God forbid) <hi>i. e.</hi> if ever the now diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant an Army at their back as then they had, and ſo ſubtile, skilful, and reſolute a General to conduct them, and ſo many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous people at their heels, waiting to enrich themſelves by the ſpoil of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> Lands (ſo dividing the Lions
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42196:128"/>skin when once he were dead) from a real dread of thereby plunging themſelves into everlaſting flames, they would rather burn at a ſtake, than have their hands in ſuch another buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up all, I have been induced to inſiſt ſo long upon the heinouſneſs and danger of their ſin who put the King to death, becauſe a thorow belief, and due conſideration of what I have ſaid (and I do aver it is all true) might and would in my opinion, be a very great ſecurity againſt all publick Mutinies, <hi>Inſurrections,</hi> and <hi>Civil Wars</hi> hereafter. For if the people of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> did univerſally, and all as one man dread the thoughts of <hi>Regicide,</hi> as of a ſin next to that which is <hi>unpardonable,</hi> there would be no cauſe to fear <hi>Rebellion;</hi> for then would men be govern'd and over-aw'd by this <hi>Dilemna: If the King againſt whom we rebel ſhall always keep his head, we ſhall loſe our lives firſt or laſt; but if he loſe his head by our means and contrivances, we ſhall be in great danger to loſe our Souls, which is worſe. For what will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and to loſe his own Soul?</hi>
